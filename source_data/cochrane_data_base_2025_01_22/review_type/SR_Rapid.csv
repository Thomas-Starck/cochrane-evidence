Following an episode of rheumatic fever, there is a risk of developing rheumatic heart disease (RHD) later in life that carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality. RHD remains the largest global cause of cardiovascular disease in the young (age < 25 years). The historical literature provides inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial in reducing the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever and development of RHD. Antibiotics are thought to work by reducing the carriage of group A  Streptococcus  and thus reducing the risk of infection. This review was commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) for an upcoming guideline. Objectives 1. To assess the effects of long‐term antibiotics versus no antibiotics (control) for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and associated sequelae in people with previous rheumatic fever or RHD. 2. To assess the effects of long‐term intramuscular penicillin versus long‐term oral antibiotics for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and associated sequelae in people with previous rheumatic fever or RHD. Search methods We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science, clinical trial registers, ISRCTN.com and reference lists without restrictions on language or date up to 10 March 2024. Selection criteria We sought randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised trials, described in any language, including participants with previous rheumatic fever and/or RHD of any age, based in community or hospital settings. Studies were included if they compared firstly antibiotic prophylaxis with no antibiotic prophylaxis, and, secondly, intramuscular penicillin prophylaxis versus oral antibiotic prophylaxis. Data collection and analysis We used standardised methodological, Cochrane‐endorsed procedures and performed meta‐analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of rheumatic fever, progression or severity of RHD and cardiac complications. Our secondary outcomes were obstetric complications (maternal and foetal events), mortality, treatment adherence, adverse events and acceptability to participants. We performed comprehensive assessments of risk of bias and certainty of evidence, applying the GRADE methodology. Main results We included 11 studies (seven RCTs and four quasi‐randomised trials) including 3951 participants. The majority of the included studies were conducted in the USA, UK and Canada during the 1950s to 1960s. Most participants with previous rheumatic fever had been diagnosed using the modified Jones criteria (mJC) (four studies), were an average of 12.3 years of age and 50.6% male. We assessed the majority of the included studies to be at high risk of bias, predominantly relating to blinding and attrition bias. Comparison one: antibiotics versus no antibiotics Pooled meta‐analysis of six RCTs provides moderate‐certainty evidence that antibiotics overall (oral or intramuscular) probably reduce the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever substantially (0.7% versus 1.7%, respectively) (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69; 1721 participants). People with early or mild RHD likely have the greatest capacity to benefit from intramuscular antibiotic prophylaxis (8.1%) compared to no antibiotics (0.7%) (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.29; 1 study, 818 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Antibiotics may not affect mortality in people with late‐stage RHD (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.94; 1 study, 994 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Antibiotics may not affect the risk of anaphylaxis (Peto odds ratio (OR) 7.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 372; 1 study, 818 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or sciatic nerve injury (Peto OR 7.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 372; 1 study, 818 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared with no antibiotics, but probably have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (RR 137, 8.51 to 2210; 2 studies, 894 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and local reactions (RR 29, 1.74 to 485; 1 study, 818 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Comparison two: intramuscular antibiotics versus oral antibiotics Pooled analysis of two RCTs showed that prophylactic intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin likely reduces recurrence of rheumatic fever substantially when compared to oral antibiotics (0.1% versus 1%, respectively) (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.26; 395 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Furthermore, it is unclear whether intramuscular benzyl penicillin is superior to oral antibiotics in reducing the risk of mortality in the context of RHD (Peto OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.12; 1 study, 431 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no data available on progression of latent RHD or adverse events including anaphylaxis, sciatic nerve injury, delayed hypersensitivity/allergic reactions and local reactions to injection. Authors' conclusions This review provides evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis likely reduces the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever compared to no antibiotics, and that intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin is probably superior to oral antibiotics (approximately 10 times better). Moreover, intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin likely reduces the risk of progression of latent RHD. Evidence is scarce, but antibiotics compared with no antibiotics may not affect the risk of anaphylaxis or sciatic nerve injury, but probably carry an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and local reactions. Antibiotics may not affect all‐cause mortality in late‐stage RHD compared to no antibiotics. There is no evidence available to comment on the effect of intramuscular penicillin over oral antibiotics for progression of latent RHD and adverse events, and little evidence for all‐cause mortality. It is important to interpret these findings in the context of major limitations, including the following: the vast majority of the included studies were conducted more than 50 years ago, many before contemporary echocardiographic studies; methodology was often at high risk of bias; outdated treatments were used; only one study was in latent RHD; and there are concerns regarding generalisability to low socioeconomic regions. This underlines the need for ongoing research to understand who benefits most from prophylaxis. Plain language summary Do long‐term antibiotics help to reduce rheumatic fever recurrence and progression of rheumatic heart disease? Key messages In people who have had previous rheumatic fever (the body attacking itself in response to bacterial infection) or have rheumatic heart disease (long‐term damage to the heart due to rheumatic fever): ‐ long‐term antibiotics (either injected into the muscle every month or taken as a tablet every day) probably reduce the risk of getting more episodes of rheumatic fever compared to no antibiotics; ‐ intramuscular antibiotics probably reduce the progression (getting worse) of early heart disease compared to no antibiotic; however, there is no evidence to compare intramuscular with oral antibiotics for progression of late‐stage heart disease; ‐ antibiotics may not increase the risk of complications, such as a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). What is rheumatic heart disease? Rheumatic heart disease is the top cause of heart disease in young people worldwide and kills about one‐third of a million people every year. Rheumatic fever happens when the body's own defences go wrong, often because of a throat infection, fighting the heart instead of the bacteria. This can then lead to damage to the heart valves (gateways between rooms in the heart) called rheumatic heart disease. Antibiotics kill bacteria that can cause infections, reducing the risk of people developing rheumatic fever. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out whether and, if so, how effective antibiotics are at reducing the chances of getting rheumatic fever again, and this leading to rheumatic heart disease. What did we do? We included studies that randomly gave people with past rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease antibiotics or not (e.g. based on flipping a coin). We were interested in comparing, firstly, long‐term antibiotics with no antibiotics and, secondly, long‐term intramuscular penicillin with long‐term oral antibiotics. Participants in the studies we included had previous rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease, but could be any age. We looked for lots of different events that could have happened, including the rheumatic fever coming back (rheumatic fever recurrence), rheumatic heart disease getting worse (progression of rheumatic heart disease), problems with the heart (carditis), problems around pregnancy and birth (obstetric complications and foetal/neonatal events), death (mortality), whether people stuck to their treatment (treatment adherence), other problems such as dangerous breathing problems (anaphylaxis), complications such as nerve injury and whether the people included were happy with having antibiotics. What did we find? We found 11 studies (3951 participants) to help us answer our questions. People in these studies were an average of 12.3 years of age and were 50.6% male. Most had had previous episodes of rheumatic fever. We found that using long‐term antibiotics (either injected into the muscle every month or taken as a tablet every day) compared with no antibiotic probably reduces the risk of getting more episodes of rheumatic fever. The injection into a muscle route probably works better than the tablets. If you have the early stages of rheumatic heart disease picked up on an echocardiogram of the heart (a scan that uses sound waves to see the internal structure of the heart), then penicillin antibiotics injected into the muscle every month compared with no antibiotic likely reduces the risk of these heart problems getting worse. We found some evidence that antibiotics injected into the muscle compared with no antibiotics may not cause a very high risk of allergic reaction that affects breathing (anaphylaxis), but probably comes with a higher chance of redness at the injection side and allergic reactions to antibiotics. There was not much information on death rates or nerve injury, and no evidence on whether an antibiotic injection is better than tablets for preventing latent (early) rheumatic heart disease getting worse. What are the limitations of the evidence? The majority of the included studies (nine) were not carried out in low‐income countries, which currently have the most cases of rheumatic heart disease. This makes these results potentially less relevant to people in these countries. There is also little information on important questions other than recurrence of rheumatic fever or progression of rheumatic heart disease. There were some other potential limitations in the evidence: we flagged six studies as having issues with blinding (study participants or staff knowing whether they received antibiotics and so potentially answering based on this information). It is possible that people in many of the included studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Four studies may have had a problem with the process for placing people randomly into groups. For some of the results in the review, we only had one study. More high‐quality work is needed that is relevant to the parts of the world where rheumatic fever is currently most common. More research looking at early (latent) rheumatic heart disease, where the biggest differences may be made, is also needed. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is current to 10 March 2024. Whilst this is the most up‐to‐date review available currently, most of the evidence in this review is from the 1950s to 1960s, so some of the treatments may be outdated.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Antibiotic Prophylaxis [methods]; *Disease Progression; *Rheumatic Fever [complications, drug therapy, prevention & control]; *Rheumatic Heart Disease [prevention & control]; *Secondary Prevention [methods]; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Anti-Bacterial Agents [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Child; Humans; Injections, Intramuscular; Penicillins [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence","10.1002/14651858.CD015779","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015779","Central Editorial Service"

Several public health and social measures were implemented in schools to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and prevent onward transmission. We built upon methods from a previous Cochrane review to capture current empirical evidence relating to the effectiveness of school measures to limit SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. Objectives To provide an updated assessment of the evidence on the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to keep schools open safely during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Educational Resources Information Center, World Health Organization (WHO) COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence Synthesis Program COVID‐19 Evidence Reviews on 18 February 2022. Selection criteria Eligible studies focused on measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic, among students (aged 4 to 18 years) or individuals relating to the school, or both. We categorized studies that reported quantitative measures of intervention effectiveness, and studies that assessed the performance of surveillance measures as either ‘main’ or ‘supporting’ studies based on design and approach to handling key confounders. We were interested in transmission‐related outcomes and intended or unintended consequences. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts. We extracted minimal data for supporting studies. For main studies, one review author extracted comprehensive data and assessed risk of bias, which a second author checked. We narratively synthesized findings for each intervention‐comparator‐outcome category (body of evidence). Two review authors assessed certainty of evidence. Main results The 15 main studies consisted of measures to reduce contacts (4 studies), make contacts safer (7 studies), surveillance and response measures (6 studies; 1 assessed transmission outcomes, 5 assessed performance of surveillance measures), and multicomponent measures (1 study). These main studies assessed outcomes in the school population (12), general population (2), and adults living with a school‐attending child (1). Settings included K‐12 (kindergarten to grade 12; 9 studies), secondary (3 studies), and K‐8 (kindergarten to grade 8; 1 study) schools. Two studies did not clearly report settings. Studies measured transmission‐related outcomes (10), performance of surveillance measures (5), and intended and unintended consequences (4). The 15 main studies were based in the WHO Region of the Americas (12) and the WHO European Region (3). Comparators were more versus less intense measures, single versus multicomponent measures, and measures versus no measures. We organized results into relevant bodies of evidence, or groups of studies relating to the same 'intervention‐comparator‐outcome' categories. Across all bodies of evidence, certainty of evidence ratings limit our confidence in findings. Where we describe an effect as 'beneficial', the direction of the point estimate of the eﬀect favours the intervention; a 'harmful' eﬀect does not favour the intervention and ‘null’ shows no effect either way. Measures to reduce contact (4 studies)  We grouped studies into 21 bodies of evidence: moderate‐ (10 bodies), low‐ (3 bodies), or very low‐certainty evidence (8 bodies). The evidence was very low to moderate certainty for beneficial effects of remote versus in‐person or hybrid teaching on transmission in the general population. For students and staff, mostly harmful effects were observed when more students participated in remote teaching. Moderate‐certainty evidence showed that in the general population there was probably no effect on deaths and a beneficial effect on hospitalizations for remote versus in‐person teaching, but no effect for remote versus hybrid teaching. The effects of hybrid teaching, a combination of in‐person and remote teaching, were mixed. Very low‐certainty evidence showed that there may have been a harmful eﬀect on risk of infection among adults living with a school student for closing playgrounds and cafeterias, a null eﬀect for keeping the same teacher, and a beneficial eﬀect for cancelling extracurricular activities, keeping the same students together and restricting entry for parents and caregivers. Measures to make contact safer (7 studies)   We grouped studies into eight bodies of evidence: moderate‐ (5 bodies), and low‐certainty evidence (3 bodies). Low‐certainty evidence showed that there may have been a beneficial effect of mask mandates on transmission‐related outcomes. Moderate‐certainty evidence showed full mandates were probably more beneficial than partial or no mandates. Evidence of a beneficial effect of physical distancing on risk of infection among staff and students was mixed. Moderate‐certainty evidence showed that ventilation measures probably reduce cases among staﬀ and students. One study (very low‐certainty evidence) found that there may be a beneficial eﬀect of not sharing supplies and increasing desk space on risk of infection for adults living with a school student, but showed there may be a harmful eﬀect of desk shields. Surveillance and response measures (6 studies)  We grouped studies into seven bodies of evidence: moderate‐ (3 bodies), low‐ (1 body), and very low‐certainty evidence (3 bodies). Daily testing strategies to replace or reduce quarantine probably helped to reduce missed school days and decrease the proportion of asymptomatic school contacts testing positive (moderate‐certainty evidence). For studies that assessed the performance of surveillance measures, the proportion of cases detected by rapid antigen detection testing ranged from 28.6% to 95.8%, positive predictive value ranged from 24.0% to 100.0% (very low‐certainty evidence). There was probably no onward transmission from contacts of a positive case (moderate‐certainty evidence) and replacing or shortening quarantine with testing may have reduced missed school days (low‐certainty evidence). Multicomponent measures (1 study)  Combining multiple measures may have led to a reduction in risk of infection among adults living with a student (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions A range of measures can have a beneficial effect on transmission‐related outcomes, healthcare utilization and school attendance. We rated the current findings at a higher level of certainty than the original review. Further high‐quality research into school measures to control SARS‐CoV‐2 in a wider variety of contexts is needed to develop a more evidence‐based understanding of how to keep schools open safely during COVID‐19 or a similar public health emergency. Plain language summary Were measures taken by schools to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic effective? Key messages • Overall, results suggested that a range of school measures to reduce the spread of COVID‐19 may reduce the spread of disease, use of healthcare facilities and days of school attendance otherwise lost to quarantine. • More high‐quality research is needed to help understand how schools can safely be kept open during possible future pandemics. What kind of measures did schools take during the COVID‐19 pandemic? During the COVID‐19 pandemic, many societies introduced special measures in schools to reduce the spread of COVID‐19 and to keep pupils and staff safe. We grouped measures into the following broad categories. 1. Measures to reduce the opportunity for contact, like reducing the number of students in a class or a school at one time. 2. Measures to make contacts safer, including face masks, improved ventilation, cleaning, handwashing, or modifying activities like sports or music.  3. Surveillance and response measures, which screen for symptoms or test sick students or staff. People with COVID‐19 may self‐isolate and those who might have COVID‐19 may be quarantined. 4. Multicomponent measures combine measures from categories 1, 2 and/or 3. What did we want to find out? We aimed to find out which measures allowed schools to safely reopen or stay open during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We wanted to know which measures were best at preventing the spread of disease (transmission), measured by number of new cases, deaths and hospitalization. We also looked at unintended consequences, such as the effect on children's lives outside school and their education. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the impact of these measures in schools among students (aged 4 to 18 years) or individuals relating to the school (staff or parents, for example), or both, on the number of people with COVID‐19, the healthcare system (hospital beds, for example) and social aspects (such as the effect on children's education). We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What are the main results of the review? We included 33 studies. Fifteen studies provided evidence on our most important points and the rest did not provide such useful evidence. Studies took place in primary and secondary schools, mostly in North America but also in Europe. 1. Measures to reduce the opportunity for contacts  Four studies from the USA investigated the impact of school measures to reduce contact. Remote teaching (e.g. over a computer link) compared to in‐person teaching probably reduced the spread of COVID‐19 and hospitalizations, but probably had no effect on deaths in the general population. The effects of hybrid teaching (a combination of in‐person and remote teaching), compared to remote teaching were mixed. We found that other measures had mixed effects. Closing playgrounds and cafeterias may have increased risk of infection. Keeping the same teacher may have had no effect, and cancelling out‐of‐school activities, keeping the same students together, and restricting entry for parents and caregivers may have reduced the risk of infection. However, this evidence is very uncertain. 2. Measures to make contacts safer  Seven studies from the USA showed that mask wearing may have reduced the spread of COVID‐19 and that a stricter mask policy probably had a larger effect. There was mixed evidence of an effect of physical distancing on risk of infection, with results showing that there was probably a decrease in risk for students, but an increase for staff. There was some evidence that improved ventilation in school buildings probably reduced transmission. One study found that not sharing supplies and increasing desk space in schools may have reduced risk of infection, but that desk shields may have increased it, but we are very uncertain about this evidence. 3. Surveillance and response measures  Six studies from the USA, UK, Germany and Israel investigated surveillance and response measures. One study found that daily testing to replace or reduce quarantine probably helped to reduce transmission. Studies that evaluated surveillance measures found mixed results for transmission with rapid antigen test home testing, but the evidence was very uncertain. Studies looking at polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory tests also showed that there was probably no spread of COVID‐19 at school and at home after students or staff were in the same room as someone who had tested positive. Two studies found that replacing or making quarantine shorter using daily testing may have been related to missing less school. 4. Multicomponent measures  One study from the USA showed fewer infections when a higher number of measures were in place, but the evidence was very uncertain. How confident are we in the findings of this review? The evidence for this updated review is stronger than the findings of the original review in most areas. The depth, breadth and quality of the research needs to be strengthened, with better study designs and adjustment for risk factors. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to February 2022.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*COVID-19 [epidemiology, prevention & control, transmission]; *Pandemics [prevention & control]; *SARS-CoV-2; *Schools; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD015029.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015029.pub2","Public Health"

The rapid review was published when little was known about transmission, treatment or future vaccination, and when physical distancing measures (isolation, quarantine, contact tracing, crowd avoidance, work and school measures) were the cornerstone of public health responses globally. This updated review includes more recent evidence to extend what we know about effective pandemic public health communication. This includes considerations of changes needed over time to maintain responsiveness to pandemic transmission waves, the (in)equities and variable needs of groups within communities due to the pandemic, and highlights again the critical role of effective communication as integral to the public health response. Objectives To update the evidence on the question 'What are relevant, feasible and effective communication approaches to promote acceptance, uptake and adherence to physical distancing measures for COVID‐19 prevention and control?', our primary focus was communication approaches to promote and support acceptance, uptake and adherence to physical distancing. Secondary objective: to explore and identify key elements of effective communication for physical distancing measures for different (diverse) populations and groups. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases from inception, with searches for this update including the period 1 January 2020 to 18 August 2021. Systematic review and study repositories and grey literature sources were searched in August 2021 and guidelines identified for the eCOVID19 Recommendations Map were screened (November 2021). Selection criteria Guidelines or reviews focusing on communication (information, education, reminders, facilitating decision‐making, skills acquisition, supporting behaviour change, support, involvement in decision‐making) related to physical distancing measures for prevention and/or control of COVID‐19 or selected other diseases (sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza, Ebola virus disease (EVD) or tuberculosis (TB)) were included. New evidence was added to guidelines, reviews and primary studies included in the 2020 review. Data collection and analysis Methods were based on the original rapid review, using methods developed by McMaster University and informed by Cochrane rapid review guidance. Screening, data extraction, quality assessment and synthesis were conducted by one author and checked by a second author. Synthesis of results was conducted using modified framework analysis, with themes from the original review used as an initial framework. Main results This review update includes 68 studies, with 17 guidelines and 20 reviews added to the original 31 studies. Synthesis identified six major themes, which can be used to inform policy and decision‐making related to planning and implementing communication about a public health emergency and measures to protect the community. Theme 1: Strengthening public trust and countering misinformation: essential foundations for effective public health communication Recognising the key role of public trust is essential. Working to build and maintain trust over time underpins the success of public health communications and, therefore, the effectiveness of public health prevention measures. Theme 2: Two‐way communication: involving communities to improve the dissemination, accessibility and acceptability of information Two‐way communication (engagement) with the public is needed over the course of a public health emergency: at first, recognition of a health threat (despite uncertainties), and regularly as public health measures are introduced or adjusted. Engagement needs to be embedded at all stages of the response and inform tailoring of communications and implementation of public health measures over time. Theme 3: Development of and preparation for public communication: target audience, equity and tailoring Communication and information must be tailored to reach all groups within populations, and explicitly consider existing inequities and the needs of disadvantaged groups, including those who are underserved, vulnerable, from diverse cultural or language groups, or who have lower educational attainment. Awareness that implementing public health measures may magnify existing or emerging inequities is also needed in response planning, enactment and adjustment over time. Theme 4: Public communication features: content, timing and duration, delivery Public communication needs to be based on clear, consistent, actionable and timely (up‐to‐date) information about preventive measures, including the benefits (whether for individual, social groupings or wider society), harms (likewise) and rationale for use, and include information about supports available to help follow recommended measures. Communication needs to occur through multiple channels and/or formats to build public trust and reach more of the community. Theme 5: Supporting behaviour change at individual and population levels Supporting implementation of public health measures with practical supports and services (e.g. essential supplies, financial support) is critical. Information about available supports must be widely disseminated and well understood. Supports and communication related to them require flexibility and tailoring to explicitly consider community needs, including those of vulnerable groups. Proactively monitoring and countering stigma related to preventive measures (e.g. quarantine) is also necessary to support adherence. Theme 6: Fostering and sustaining receptiveness and responsiveness to public health communication Efforts to foster and sustain public receptiveness and responsiveness to public health communication are needed throughout a public health emergency. Trust, acceptance and behaviours change over time, and communication needs to be adaptive and responsive to these changing needs. Ongoing community engagement efforts should inform communication and public health response measures. Authors' conclusions Implications for practice Evidence highlights the critical role of communication throughout a public health emergency. Like any intervention, communication can be done well or poorly, but the consequences of poor communication during a pandemic may mean the difference between life and death. The approaches to effective communication identified in this review can be used by policymakers and decision‐makers, working closely with communication teams, to plan, implement and adjust public communications over the course of a public health emergency like the COVID‐19 pandemic. Implications for research Despite massive growth in research during the COVID‐19 period, gaps in the evidence persist and require high‐quality, meaningful research. This includes investigating the experiences of people at heightened COVID‐19 risk, and identifying barriers to implementing public communication and protective health measures particular to lower‐ and middle‐income countries, and how to overcome these. Plain language summary How can we communicate better with people and communities about measures which help to prevent and control COVID‐19? Key messages ‐ During a pandemic, governments and other authorities need to clearly communicate with the public about how people can keep themselves safe. This communication needs to be based on trust and well‐planned. People and communities affected by the pandemic need to be involved in planning and delivering the communication. The communication should reach all people across the community, including those who have trouble reading and writing, people who speak languages other than the community's dominant language, and people who face other types of disadvantage. Clear communication can improve how well people are able to follow measures to keep themselves safe. ‐ This review identified six themes which can guide best‐practice approaches to public health communication during a pandemic. These themes are: 1) Strengthening public trust and countering misinformation; 2) Two‐way communication involving communities so that people have input into how communication can best happen; 3) Development of and preparation for public communication by considering who the audience is and how different people's needs within the community can be met; 4) Public communication features, including how and when messages are delivered to communities; 5) Supporting behaviour change at individual and population levels; 6) Fostering and sustaining receptiveness and responsiveness to public health communication over time. ‐ The review findings can help governments and other authorities make decisions about public health communication during a pandemic. The findings are relevant to COVID‐19 and future public health emergencies. The findings can be applied across different countries and different emergency situations. ‐ Some gaps in the research were found through this review. These included: communication with people who are at higher risk of getting severely sick or dying from COVID‐19; communication in lower‐ and middle‐income countries; and communication in settings known for social inequalities. Further research in these areas may help increase knowledge and improve practices related to pandemic communication. What are physical distancing measures? The term 'physical distancing measures' describes ways to reduce the spread of diseases such as COVID‐19 by reducing physical contact between people. Physical distancing measures include contact tracing, avoiding crowds, isolating, quarantine, and measures to reduce transmission in schools and workplaces. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which ways of communicating with the public are best to increase people's understanding and use of physical distancing measures to protect themselves and limit the spread of COVID‐19 and other similar diseases. We also wanted to find out whether there were ways of communicating that worked better for certain groups in the community, including people who experience disadvantage. What did we do? This review is an update of a review conducted in 2020. The 2020 review included primary studies (qualitative and quantitative) and secondary sources (review studies and guidelines). During the searches for this update, we looked for guidelines or review studies examining communication about physical distancing measures for preventing and/or controlling COVID‐19 or selected other infectious diseases. We compared and summarised the results of included studies and guidelines, together with the findings from the 2020 review. What did we find? This review has 68 included studies (guidelines, reviews and primary studies [studies undertaken by researcher(s) which collect original data]). This update added 17 guidelines and 20 reviews (which are considered secondary research) to the original 2020 review. We identified six main themes related to planning and implementing communication about physical distancing during a pandemic. These themes can inform policy and decision‐making around pandemic and public health emergency communication. These themes are: 1) Strengthening public trust and countering misinformation; 2) Two‐way communication; 3) Development of and preparation for public communication; 4) Public communication features; 5) Supporting behaviour change at individual and population levels; 6) Fostering and sustaining receptiveness and responsiveness to public health communication. What are the limitations of the evidence? This update focused on reviews and guidelines. Typically, these represent the best available evidence but, in this update, were mainly rated as having low or moderate quality. Because of studies' different designs, the quality ratings are not meant to be used as a hierarchy (ranking) of evidence. A strength of this review is that major themes and findings came from diverse sources, including primary studies, reviews and guidelines. Often, similar findings were reported across different study types, populations and settings.

Having similar findings across different study types, and adding new information through this update, increases our confidence in the findings even though most of the included studies are of low or moderate quality.

People with COVID‐19 who develop thromboembolism have a worse prognosis. Anticoagulants such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants are used for the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti‐inflammatory potential. However, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID‐19 is still under debate. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 14 April 2021. We also checked the reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified, and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. Selection criteria Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We excluded studies without a comparator group and with a retrospective design (all previously included studies) as we were able to include better study designs. Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and necessity for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used Cochrane RoB 1 to assess the risk of bias for RCTs, ROBINS‐I to assess risk of bias for non‐randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We meta‐analysed data when appropriate. Main results We included seven studies (16,185 participants) with participants hospitalised with COVID‐19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. The mean age of participants was 55 to 68 years and the follow‐up period ranged from 15 to 90 days. The studies assessed the effects of heparinoids, direct anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists, and reported sparse data or did not report some of our outcomes of interest: necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. Higher‐dose versus lower‐dose anticoagulants (4 RCTs, 4647 participants) Higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little or no difference in all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.16, 4489 participants; 4 RCTs) and increase minor bleeding (RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.75 to 6.14, 1196 participants; 3 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (high‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants probably reduce pulmonary embolism (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70, 4360 participants; 4 RCTs), and slightly increase major bleeding (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.80, 4400 participants; 4 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (moderate‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants may result in little or no difference in deep vein thrombosis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03, 3422 participants; 4 RCTs), stroke (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.03, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), major adverse limb events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99, 1176 participants; 2 RCTs), myocardial infarction (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.55, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), atrial fibrillation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.70, 562 participants; 1 study), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.24, 2789 participants; 2 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (low‐certainty evidence). It is unclear whether higher‐dose anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). Anticoagulants versus no treatment (3 prospective NRS, 11,538 participants) Anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence is very uncertain due to two study results being at critical and serious risk of bias (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, 8395 participants; 3 NRS; very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, stroke, myocardial infarction and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). Ongoing studies We found 62 ongoing studies in hospital settings (60 RCTs, 35,470 participants; 2 prospective NRS, 120 participants) in 20 different countries. Thirty‐five ongoing studies plan to report mortality and 26 plan to report necessity for additional respiratory support. We expect 58 studies to be completed in December 2021, and four in July 2022. From 60 RCTs, 28 are comparing different doses of anticoagulants, 24 are comparing anticoagulants versus no anticoagulants, seven are comparing different types of anticoagulants, and one did not report detail of the comparator group. Authors' conclusions When compared to a lower‐dose regimen, higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little to no difference in all‐cause mortality and increase minor bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 up to 30 days. Higher‐dose anticoagulants possibly reduce pulmonary embolism, slightly increase major bleeding, may result in little to no difference in hospitalisation time, and may result in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis, stroke, major adverse limb events, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or thrombocytopenia.  Compared with no treatment, anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence comes from non‐randomised studies and is very uncertain. It is unclear whether anticoagulants have any effect on the remaining outcomes compared to no anticoagulants (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). Although we are very confident that new RCTs will not change the effects of different doses of anticoagulants on mortality and minor bleeding, high‐quality RCTs are still needed, mainly for the other primary outcome (necessity for additional respiratory support), the comparison with no anticoagulation, when comparing the types of anticoagulants and giving anticoagulants for a prolonged period of time. Plain language summary Do blood thinners prevent people who are hospitalised with COVID‐19 from developing blood clots? Key messages ‐ High‐dose blood thinners result in little or no difference in death rate and increase minor bleeding compared to low‐dose blood thinners for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Giving blood thinners compared to not giving blood thinners might reduce the death rate. ‐ It is very likely that new studies will not change the evidence about the effects of different doses of blood thinners on death rate and minor bleeding. High‐quality studies are still needed to analyse the need for additional respiratory support, giving blood thinners compared to no blood thinners, comparing different blood thinners, and giving blood thinners for extended periods. What is COVID‐19? COVID‐19 typically affects the lungs and airways; however, in addition to respiratory problems, about 16% of people hospitalised with COVID‐19 experience problems with their blood vessels, leading to blood clots forming in the arteries, veins and lungs. Nearly half of all people with severe COVID‐19 in intensive care units develop clots in their veins or arteries. What are blood thinners? Blood thinners are medicines that prevent harmful blood clots from forming (deep vein thrombosis). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as bleeding. Some guidelines recommend giving blood thinners when people are first admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots from developing, rather than waiting to see whether blood clots develop and then treating them with blood thinners. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether giving blood thinners to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 as a preventive measure reduced the number of deaths compared to people who received no treatment or those who received a placebo treatment (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no active ingredient). We also wanted to determine whether these individuals needed less support with breathing, whether they still developed harmful blood clots, whether they experienced bleeding and whether they experienced any other unwanted events. What did we do? We searched for studies that assessed blood thinners given to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots. Studies could be of any design as long as they compared a blood thinner with another blood thinner, no treatment or a placebo. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and participants could be any age as long as they were in hospital with confirmed COVID‐19 disease. We pooled the results when appropriate. What did we find? We included seven studies with 16,185 people hospitalised with COVID‐19 in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. People in the studies were aged from 55 to 68 years on average. Studies lasted from 15 to 90 days and provided evidence on deaths, bleeding, blood clotting, length of hospital stay and unwanted effects. There was little or no evidence on need for respiratory support (help with breathing), deaths related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. Higher‐dose of blood thinners compared with lower‐dose (4 studies, 4647 people)   In people who received higher compared to lower doses of blood thinners there was little to no difference in death rate. However, people on higher doses were more likely to experience minor bleeding compared to in those on lower doses. People who received higher doses of blood thinners likely had reduced pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung or blood vessel leading to the lung), slightly increased major (more severe) bleeding, and probably had little to no difference in time spent in hospital compared to those who received the lower doses of blood thinners. In people who received higher doses of blood thinners, there was little to no difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, and other unwanted events compared to those who received the lower dose of blood thinners. Blood thinners compared with no treatment (3 studies, 11,538 people)   People who received blood thinners had a reduced death rate compared to those who did not receive blood thinners, but the evidence is very uncertain. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are very confident that higher doses of blood thinners do not change the risk of death but do increase the risk of bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive blood thinners may have a lower death rate compared to those who did not receive any blood thinners. What happens next? Our searches found 62 ongoing studies with 35,470 people. We plan to add the results of these studies to our review when they are published. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*COVID-19 [complications]; *Thromboembolism; Aged; Anticoagulants [adverse effects]; Heparin [adverse effects]; Humans; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2","10.1002/14651858.CD013739.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013739.pub2","Emergency and Critical Care"

Objectives To assess the effects of IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo on effectiveness and safety outcomes in people with COVID‐19. We will update this assessment regularly. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 L‐OVE Platform (search date 5 November 2021). These sources are maintained through regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registers and other sources. We also checked the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, Retraction Watch (search date 3 November 2021). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID‐19, regardless of disease severity. Data collection and analysis We followed Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes of clinical improvement (Day 28; ≥ D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/‐ additional organ support OR death) (D28; ≥ D60); all‐cause mortality (D28; ≥ D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. Main results We identified four RCTs of anakinra (three published in peer‐reviewed journals, one reported as a preprint) and two RCTs of canakinumab (published in peer‐reviewed journals). All trials were multicentre (2 to 133 centres). Two trials stopped early (one due to futility and one as the trigger for inferiority was met). The median/mean age range varied from 58 to 68 years;   the proportion of men varied from   58% to 77%. All participants were hospitalised; 67% to 100% were on oxygen at baseline but not intubated; between 0% and 33% were intubated at baseline. We identified a further 16 registered trials with no results available, of which 15 assessed anakinra (four completed, four terminated, five ongoing, three not recruiting) and one (completed) trial assessed canakinumab. Effectiveness of anakinra for people with COVID‐19 Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 837 participants; absolute effect: 59 more per 1000 (from 22 fewer to 147 more); moderate‐certainty evidence.

The evidence is very uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with clinical improvement at ≥ D60 (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 115 participants; absolute effect: 59 fewer per 1000 (from 186 fewer to 102 more); very low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.56; 4 RCTs, 1633 participants; absolute effect: 8 more per 1000 (from 84 fewer to 147 more); very low‐certainty evidence).

The evidence is uncertain regarding an effect of anakinra on serious adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 12 fewer per 1000 (from 104 fewer to 138 more); low‐certainty evidence). Effectiveness of canakinumab for people with COVID‐19 Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.14; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 42 more per 1000 (from 33 fewer to 116 more); moderate‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions Overall, we did not find evidence for an important beneficial effect of IL‐1 blocking agents. The evidence is uncertain or very uncertain for several outcomes. Sixteen trials of anakinra and canakinumab with no results are currently registered, of which four are completed, and four terminated. The findings of this review are updated on the COVID‐NMA platform ( covid-nma.com) . Plain language summary Are medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) effective treatments for COVID‐19 and do they cause unwanted effects? Key messages • Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to show that medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, or whether they cause unwanted effects. • We found 16 studies with unpublished results. We will update this review when new data are available. • In future, we need high‐quality studies to evaluate medicines that block interleukin‐1 to treat COVID‐19.  What is interleukin‐1 and what is its role in COVID‐19? Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) is a type of protein called a cytokine, which helps to regulate the body’s immune system. In particular, IL‐1 triggers inflammation to help fight infection. In COVID‐19, as the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. However, in some people, the immune system can over‐react (called a ‘cytokine storm’) and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation and tissue damage. This can lead to severe breathing difficulties, organ failure and death. What are interleukin‐1 ‘blockers’? IL‐1 blockers are medicines that stop IL‐1 from working by blocking signals from IL‐1 to other parts of the immune system. This reduces inflammation and may help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. In turn, this may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient) and reduce the number of deaths from COVID‐19. Three IL‐1 blockers are available: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know if IL‐1 blockers are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, compared with standard care alone or with placebo (a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL‐1 blockers on: •  whether people’s symptoms got better or worse; •  how many people died; and •  any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that assessed the effects of IL‐1 blockers to treat people with COVID‐19 compared with standard care alone or with placebo. People in the studies could have suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 of any severity (mild, moderate or severe), and be any age or sex. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found six studies with 2132 people. Four studies assessed anakinra (1633 people) and two assessed canakinumab (499 people). People in the studies were aged between 58 and 68 years old on average, and the majority were men. All the people in the studies were in hospital, mainly with moderate to critical COVID‐19. The studies varied in size, from 45 to 2253 people. At the start of the studies, 67% to 100% of people were receiving oxygen, and 0% to 33% were on a ventilator. We also found 16 studies that have not yet published their results. Anakinra compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 • Anakinra probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (three studies, 837 people) but we do not know if it makes a difference at 60 days (one study, 115 people). • We do not know if anakinra makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 722 people) or at 60 days (four studies, 1633 people). • Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects at 28 days after treatment, but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 722 people).  Canakinumab compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 • Canakinumab probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people).  • We do not know if canakinumab makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people) or at 60 days (one study, 45 people).  • Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects (one study, 454 people), but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 499 people) at 28 days.  What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. All the people in the studies were hospitalised, but some were more seriously ill than others ‐ some studies only included people on a ventilator. Usual care also differed between studies, and studies measured and reported their results using different methods.  How up to date is this evidence?

Long‐term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. Objectives To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. Search methods On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews. Selection criteria We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID‐19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long‐term care facilities, and adverse health effects. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS‐I tool for cohort and interrupted‐time‐series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case‐control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. Main results We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Most studies compared outcomes in long‐term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies)  Self‐confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies)  Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain.  Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact ‐regulating and transmission ‐reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies)  Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. The measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear.  Symptom‐based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies)  Separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study)  A combination of multiple infection‐control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Authors' conclusions This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities. These may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non‐pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future. Plain language summary Can non‐medicinal measures prevent or reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in long term care facilities? Key messages • Non‐medicinal measures (e.g. visiting restrictions or regular testing) may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (causing COVID‐19 disease) in residents and staff in long term care facilities, but we have concerns about the reliability of the findings. • More high‐quality studies on real‐world experiences are needed, in particular. • More research is also needed on measures in facilities where most residents and staff are vaccinated, as well as regions other than North America and Europe. What are non‐medicinal measures? Non‐medicinal measures are ways of preventing or reducing disease without using medicine, such as vaccines. These include controlling people's movements and contacts, using personal protective equipment (PPE), or regular testing for infection. SARS‐CoV‐2 is very infectious. Elderly or disabled people, who live in care homes (long‐term care facilities), are vulnerable to infection because they live in close contact with other people, with carers and visitors entering and leaving the facility. Due to age and underlying health conditions, care home residents have an increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID‐19 and dying from the disease. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out how effective non‐medicinal measures are in preventing residents and staff in long‐term care facilities from becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in reducing the spread of the infection. We focused on all types of long‐term care facilities for adults, such as nursing homes for the elderly and skilled nursing facilities for people living with disabilities. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated the effects of non‐medicinal measures in long‐term care facilities. To be included, studies had to report how many infections, hospitalisations or deaths the measures prevented in residents or staff, or whether the measures prevented the introduction of the virus into the facilities or prevented outbreaks within facilities. We included any type of study, including observational studies that used ‘real‐world’ data, or modelling studies based on assumed data from computer‐generated simulations. What did we find? We found 22 studies, 11 observational and 11 modelling studies. All studies were conducted in North America or Europe. There were four main types of measures. 1.Entry regulation measures to prevent residents, staff or visitors introducing the virus into the facility. Measures included staff confining themselves with residents, quarantine for newly‐admitted residents, testing new admissions, not allowing the admission of new residents, and preventing visitors from entering facilities. 2. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures to prevent people passing on the virus. Measures included wearing masks or PPE, social distancing, extra cleaning, reducing contact between residents and among staff, and placing residents and staff in care groups and limiting contact between groups. 3. Surveillance measures designed to identify an outbreak early. Measures included regular testing of residents or staff regardless of symptoms, and symptom‐based testing. 4. Outbreak control measures to reduce the consequences of an outbreak. Measures included isolation of infected residents, and separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them. Some studies used a combination of these measures. Main results Entry regulation measures  (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) Most studies showed that such measures were beneficial, but some studies found no effects or unwanted effects, such as depression and delirium among residents in the context of visiting restrictions. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures  (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) Some measures may be beneficial, but often the evidence is very uncertain. Surveillance measures  (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) Routine testing of residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths among residents, although the evidence on the number of deaths among staff was less clear. Testing more often, getting test results faster, and using more accurate tests were predicted to have more beneficial effects. Outbreak control measures  (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) These measures may reduce the number of infections and the risk of outbreaks in facilities, but often the evidence is very uncertain. Combination measures  (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) A combination of different measures may be effective in reducing the number of infections and deaths. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in these results is limited. Many studies used mathematical prediction rather than real‐world data, and we cannot be confident that the model assumptions are accurate. Most observational studies did not use the most reliable methods. This means we cannot be confident that the measure caused the effect, for example, that testing of residents reduced the number of deaths. How up to date is this evidence?

Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of international travel‐related control measures during the COVID‐19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening‐related outcomes. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID‐19‐specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID‐19 Research to 13 November 2020. Selection criteria We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel‐related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID‐19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. Main results Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. Most studies compared travel‐related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel  (31 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low‐certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID‐19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low‐certainty evidence that cross‐border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID‐19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders  (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure‐based screening or test‐based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure‐based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low‐certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low‐certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test‐based screening, one modelling study provided very low‐certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low‐certainty evidence). Quarantine  (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low‐certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders  (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low‐certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. Authors' conclusions With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real‐world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel‐related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure‐based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure‐based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel‐related control measures from a societal perspective. Plain language summary Can international travel‐related control measures contain the spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic? What are international travel‐related control measures? International travel control measures are methods to manage international travel to contain the spread of COVID‐19. Measures include: ‐ closing international borders to stop travellers crossing from one country to another; ‐ restricting travel to and from certain countries, particularly those with high infection levels; ‐ screening or testing travellers entering or leaving a country if they have symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person; ‐ quarantining newly‐arrived travellers from another country, that is, requiring travellers to stay at home or in a specific place for a certain time. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out how effective international travel‐related control measures are in containing the COVID‐19 pandemic. What we did We searched for studies on the effects of these measures on the spread of COVID‐19. Studies had to report how many cases these measures prevented or detected, or whether they changed the course of the pandemic. The studies could include people of any age, anywhere. They could be of any design including those that used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies) or hypothetical data from computer‐generated simulations (modelling studies). This is the first update of our review. This update includes only studies on COVID‐19, published up to 13 November 2020. What we found We found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real‐life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID‐19 within countries varied. Most studies compared current travel‐related control measures with no travel‐related controls. However, some modelling studies also compared current measures against possible measures, for example, to see what might happen if controls were more or less relaxed or were combined with other measures. Main results Below we summarise the findings of some outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel  (31 modelling studies) Most studies showed that travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel were beneficial, but this beneficial effect ranged from small to large. Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. Screening at borders  (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies) These studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID‐19, or testing people, before or after they travelled. For screening based on symptoms or potential exposure to COVID‐19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks. Modelling studies predicted that 1% to 53% of cases would be detected. Observational studies reported a wide range of cases detected, from 0% to 100%, with the majority of studies reporting less than 54% of cases detected. For screening based on testing, studies reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases, and cases detected. Observational studies reported that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90%. This variation might be due to the timing of testing. Quarantine  (12 modelling studies) All studies suggested that quarantine may be beneficial, but the size of this effect ranged from small to large in the different studies. Modelling studies, for example, predicted that quarantine could lead to between 450 and over 64,000 fewer cases in the community. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. Quarantine and screening at borders  (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies) For quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. How reliable are these results? Our confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real‐life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross‐border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. What this means Overall, international travel‐related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID‐19 across national borders. Restricting cross‐border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID‐19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules. Future research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real‐life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel‐related control measures to individuals and society as a whole.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*SARS-CoV-2; *Travel-Related Illness; Bias; COVID-19 [epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Communicable Diseases, Imported [epidemiology, prevention & control]; Humans; Internationality; Models, Theoretical; Observational Studies as Topic; Pandemics [*prevention & control]; Quarantine","10.1002/14651858.CD013717.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013717.pub2","Public Health"

Most people infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID‐19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. Objectives We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID‐19. Search methods An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid‐19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid‐Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. Selection criteria Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS‐CoV2 is unknown. Data collection and analysis After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. Effectiveness of screening We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low‐certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. Screening test accuracy All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point‐in‐time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2, settings, and methods of measurement. We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. For single point‐in‐time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low‐certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low‐certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low‐certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low‐certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low‐certainty evidence). Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. Authors' conclusions The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT‐PCR. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers. Plain language summary How effective is screening for COVID‐19? Why does screening matter? Screening aims to identify a condition in people who may not be showing any symptoms. Some people may have the COVID‐19 virus but appear healthy or have only mild symptoms. It is important to identify infected people so they can stay away from others and seek appropriate care. Incorrectly identifying COVID‐19 in healthy people could lead to unnecessary self‐isolation and further tests. Incorrectly identifying no infection in infected people could spread the virus. Screening for COVID‐19 can include temperature checks, or asking about international travel or contact with COVID‐19 cases, or rapid tests. Screening can occur over the telephone, online, or in person, in homes, clinics, workplaces, airports or schools. What did the review study? We wanted to identify: · the benefits and negative effects of screening apparently healthy people for COVID‐19 infection; · whether screening can identify those with and without the virus correctly. To answer these questions rapidly, we shortened some steps of the normal Cochrane Review process. We are confident these changes do not affect our overall conclusions. What did we do? We looked for studies that screened people who had not sought care for potential COVID‐19 symptoms. This review includes evidence up to May 2020. Key results We found 22 studies; 17 assessed people (cohort studies) and five were computer‐generated models (modelling studies). Studies took place in USA, Europe, and Asia. Benefits and negative effects   Two modelling studies reported on the benefits and negative effects of screening. One suggested that asking about symptoms at airports may slightly slow, but not stop, the importation of infected people. Another model reported that weekly or biweekly screening of healthcare workers may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers in emergency departments. No studies reported on negative effects of screening. Identification of infected people   Seventeen cohort studies and three modelling studies reported on whether screening can correctly identify those with and without the virus. Studies varied widely in the baseline level of COVID‐19, settings, and methods. All cohort studies compared screening strategies to a ‘gold standard’ test called RT‐PCR. Cohort studies All screening strategies  (17 studies, 17,574 people), incorrectly identified: · between 20 and 100 out of 100 infected people as healthy; · between 0 and 38 people out of 100 healthy people as infected Asking about symptoms  (13 studies, 16,762 people ), incorrectly identified: · between 40 to 100 out of 100 infected people as healthy · between 0 to 34 out of 100 healthy people as infected Temperature measurements ,  asking about international travel ,  exposure to known infected people  and  exposure to known or suspected infected people  (6 studies, 14,741 people), incorrectly identified : · between 77 and 100 out of 100 infected people as healthy · between 0 and 10 out of 100 healthy people as infected Asking about symptoms plus temperature measurement  (2 studies, 779 people), incorrectly identified: · between 31 and 88 out of 100 infected people as healthy · between 0 to 10 people out of 100 healthy people as infected There was insufficient evidence from two small studies on rapid laboratory tests and repeated symptom assessment to tell how accurate they were in identifying healthy and infected people. Modelling studies  Three studies modelled entry and exit screening in airports. One study missed 70% of infected travellers. Another detected 90% of infections, but used an unrealistic scenario. The third used very unreliable methods so we cannot use evidence from this study. How confident are we in the results of the studies? Our confidence in these findings is limited because most studies did not describe their screening methods clearly, some found very few cases of infections and the types of participants and settings varied greatly, making it difficult to judge whether the results apply broadly. Authors’ conclusions One‐time screening in apparently healthy people is likely to miss people who are infected. We are unsure whether combined screenings, repeated symptom assessment, or rapid laboratory tests are useful. As more people become infected, screening will identify more cases. However, because screening can miss people who are infected, public health measures such as face coverings, physical distancing, and quarantine for those who are apparently healthy, continue to be very important.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*SARS-CoV-2; Air Travel [statistics & numerical data]; Airports; Bias; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing [standards]; COVID-19 [*diagnosis, transmission]; Cohort Studies; Diagnostic Errors [statistics & numerical data]; False Negative Reactions; False Positive Reactions; Health Personnel; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Professional-to-Patient [prevention & control]; Mass Screening [*methods]; Models, Theoretical; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Sensitivity and Specificity; Travel-Related Illness","10.1002/14651858.CD013718","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013718","Public Health"

To support the WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks. Objectives To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID‐19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission. Search methods An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020. Selection criteria Cohort studies, case‐control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID‐19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate. Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full‐text publications. One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS‐I for non‐randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non‐randomised, non‐controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs. Main results We included 51 studies; 4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID‐19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta‐analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis. We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI. We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non‐controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5. We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies. Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID‐19 case in comparison to no quarantine Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID‐19, 1 on SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID‐19, 1 on SARS, low‐certainty evidence). Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID‐19, low‐certainty evidence). Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS). Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID‐19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID‐19; onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID‐19; mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID‐19, low‐certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID‐19. Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID‐19 outbreak compared to no quarantine Very low‐certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID‐19 (2 observational studies on COVID‐19 and 2 observational studies on SARS). Authors' conclusions The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID‐19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID‐19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact of the measures implemented. This review was originally commissioned by the WHO and supported by Danube‐University‐Krems. The update was self‐initiated by the review authors. Plain language summary Does quarantine, alone or in combination with other public health measures, control coronavirus (COVID‐19)? Background   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by a new virus that has spread quickly throughout the world. Most infected people either experience no symptoms or suffer mild, flu‐like symptoms, but some become seriously ill, and may die.  There is no vaccine (a medicine that stops people catching a specific disease) for COVID‐19, so other ways of slowing its spread are needed. One way of controlling the disease is quarantine. This means separating healthy people from other healthy people, who may have the virus after being in close contact with an infected person, or because they have returned from an area with high infection rates. Similar recommendations include isolation (like quarantine, but for people who tested positive for COVID‐19) and physical distancing (people without symptoms keep a distance from each other).   What did we want to find out?   We wanted to find out whether and how effectively quarantine stops COVID‐19 spreading and if it prevents death. We wanted to know if it was more effective when combined with other measures, and how much it costs.   Study characteristics  COVID‐19 is spreading rapidly, so we needed to answer these questions as quickly as possible. This meant we shortened some steps of the normal Cochrane Review process. Nevertheless, we are confident that these changes do not affect our overall conclusions.  We looked for studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine, anywhere, on the spread and severity of COVID‐19. We also looked for studies that assessed quarantine alongside other measures, such as isolation, physical distancing or school closures. COVID‐19 is a new disease, so, to find as much evidence as possible, we also looked for studies on similar viruses, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).  Studies measured the number of COVID‐19, SARS or MERS cases, how many people were infected, how quickly the virus spread, how many people died, and the costs of quarantine.   Key results  We included 51 studies. Thirty‐two studies focused on COVID‐19, 14 on SARS, three on SARS plus other viruses, and two on MERS. Most studies combined existing data from multiple sources and assumptions to create a model (a simulation) for predicting how events might occur over time, for people in different situations (called modelling studies). Four COVID‐19 studies observed the effects of quarantine (observational studies) on 6064 individuals in China, Greece and Singapore. Twenty‐eight COVID‐19 studies simulated outbreaks in Algeria, China, Canada, Italy, Kazakhstan, Nepal, UK, USA, Singapore, South Korea, on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, and in a general population. Four studies looked back on the effect of quarantine on 178,122 people involved in SARS and MERS outbreaks. The remaining 15 studies modelled SARS and MERS outbreaks. The modelling studies all found that simulated quarantine measures reduce the number of people with COVID‐19 and the number of deaths. With quarantine, estimates showed a minimum reduction in the number of people with COVID‐19 of 44%, and a maximum reduction of 96%. Similarly, with quarantine, estimates of the number of deaths showed a minimum reduction of 31%, and a maximum reduction of 76%. Combining quarantine with other measures, such as closing schools or physical distancing, may be more effective at reducing the spread of COVID‐19 than quarantine alone. The SARS and MERS studies agreed with the studies on COVID‐19.  Two SARS modelling studies assessed costs. They found that the costs may be lower when quarantine measures start earlier.   Reliability of the evidence   We are uncertain about the evidence we found for several reasons. The observational studies on COVID‐19 did not include a comparison group without quarantine. The COVID‐19 studies based their models on limited data and made different assumptions about the virus (e.g. how quickly it would spread). The other studies investigated SARS and MERS so they only provide indirect evidence.   Conclusion  Despite limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important in reducing the number of people infected and the number of deaths. Results suggest that quarantine was most effective, and cost less, when it started earlier. Combining quarantine with other prevention and control measures may have a greater effect than quarantine alone. This review includes evidence published up to 23 June 2020.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Models, Theoretical; *Pandemics; *Public Health; *Quarantine; Bias; COVID-19 [epidemiology, mortality, *prevention & control]; Coronavirus Infections [epidemiology, mortality, prevention & control]; Humans; Incidence; Observational Studies as Topic; Physical Distancing; SARS-CoV-2 [pathogenicity]; Schools; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [epidemiology, mortality, prevention & control]; Travel; World Health Organization","10.1002/14651858.CD013574.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013574.pub2","Infectious Diseases"

An up‐to‐date understanding of how best to target this therapy (e.g. arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) aim) in these patients is urgently required. Objectives To address how oxygen therapy should be targeted in adults with ARDS (particularly ARDS secondary to COVID‐19 or other respiratory viruses) and requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit, and the impact oxygen therapy has on mortality, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, requirement for renal replacement therapy, and quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 May 2020 for ongoing or completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria Two review authors independently assessed all records in accordance with standard Cochrane methodology for study selection. We included RCTs comparing supplemental oxygen administration (i.e. different target PaO 2  or SpO 2  ranges) in adults with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We excluded studies exploring oxygen administration in patients with different underlying diagnoses or those receiving non‐invasive ventilation, high‐flow nasal oxygen, or oxygen via facemask. Data collection and analysis One review author performed data extraction, which a second review author checked. We assessed risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of the evidence for the following outcomes; mortality at longest follow‐up, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, and requirement for renal replacement therapy. Main results We identified one completed RCT evaluating oxygen targets in patients with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. The study randomized 205 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to either conservative (PaO 2  55 to 70 mmHg, or SpO 2  88% to 92%) or liberal (PaO 2  90 to 105 mmHg, or SpO 2   ≥  96%) oxygen therapy for seven days. Overall risk of bias was high (due to lack of blinding, small numbers of participants, and the trial stopping prematurely), and we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. The available data suggested that mortality at 90 days may be higher in those participants receiving a lower oxygen target (odds ratio (OR) 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 3.27). There was no evidence of a difference between the lower and higher target groups in mean number of days ventilated (14.0, 95% CI 10.0 to 18.0 versus 14.5, 95% CI 11.8 to 17.1); number of days of catecholamine use (8.0, 95% CI 5.5 to 10.5 versus 7.2, 95% CI 5.9 to 8.4); or participants receiving renal replacement therapy (13.7%, 95% CI 5.8% to 21.6% versus 12.0%, 95% CI 5.0% to 19.1%). Quality of life was not reported. Authors' conclusions We are very uncertain as to whether a higher or lower oxygen target is more beneficial in patients with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We identified only one RCT with a total of 205 participants exploring this question, and rated the risk of bias as high and the certainty of the findings as very low. Further well‐conducted studies are urgently needed to increase the certainty of the findings reported here. This review should be updated when more evidence is available. Plain language summary Approaches to guiding oxygen therapy in adult intensive care patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a very severe breathing problem with a high mortality rate (chance of dying). It has many potential causes, including viral infections such as COVID‐19, and there are no specific treatments for it except for giving patients oxygen via a ventilator (artificial breathing machine) on an intensive care unit, often for long periods of time. However, large amounts of oxygen (either a high concentration of oxygen or oxygen administered for a long period of time) are associated with increased harm due to other illnesses (e.g. heart attack or stroke). What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether patients with severe lung problems (ARDS) would do better (including less chance of dying) if they received higher or lower amounts of oxygen whilst they were on a ventilator in intensive care. Methods We searched major medical databases up to 15 May 2020 for clinical trials studying oxygen use in adult patients with ARDS in intensive care units. We only searched for studies with the sickest patients, that is those who needed help with their breathing through a breathing tube that was connected to an artificial breathing machine. We did not restrict the search by language of publication. In addition to extracting and analysing the data from any studies that met these criteria, we also assessed the risk of bias (fairness) and the certainty (confidence) of the findings. Results We included only one study (205 participants) in the review. Patients with ARDS and receiving oxygen through a breathing tube in an intensive care unit may have a higher chance of death if they receive lower amounts of oxygen compared to receiving much higher amounts of oxygen, but the evidence is very uncertain. Certainty of evidence Our certainty (confidence) in these findings is very low as data were only available from one study that had only a small number of participants, and was stopped earlier than anticipated because of safety concerns. We are therefore unable to definitively say whether giving more or less oxygen to ARDS patients is helpful.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Betacoronavirus; *Intensive Care Units; *Respiration, Artificial [statistics & numerical data]; Bias; COVID-19; Catecholamines [therapeutic use]; Conservative Treatment; Coronavirus Infections [*complications]; Humans; Odds Ratio; Oxygen [*administration & dosage]; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral [*complications]; Renal Replacement Therapy [statistics & numerical data]; Respiratory Distress Syndrome [mortality, *therapy, virology]; SARS-CoV-2; Self Concept; Time Factors","10.1002/14651858.CD013708","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013708","Emergency and Critical Care"

Contact tracing identifies people who were recently in contact with an infected individual, in order to isolate them and reduce further transmission. Digital technology could be implemented to augment and accelerate manual contact tracing. Digital tools for contact tracing may be grouped into three areas: 1) outbreak response; 2) proximity tracing; and 3) symptom tracking. We conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of digital solutions to contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. Objectives To assess the benefits, harms, and acceptability of personal digital contact tracing solutions for identifying contacts of an identified positive case of an infectious disease. Search methods An information specialist searched the literature from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Additionally, we screened the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies and modelling studies, in general populations. We preferentially included studies of contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks (including COVID‐19, Ebola, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome) as direct evidence, but considered comparative studies of contact tracing outside an outbreak as indirect evidence. The digital solutions varied but typically included software (or firmware) for users to install on their devices or to be uploaded to devices provided by governments or third parties. Control measures included traditional or manual contact tracing, self‐reported diaries and surveys, interviews, other standard methods for determining close contacts, and other technologies compared to digital solutions (e.g. electronic medical records). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened records and all potentially relevant full‐text publications. One review author extracted data for 50% of the included studies, another extracted data for the remaining 50%; the second review author checked all the extracted data. One review author assessed quality of included studies and a second checked the assessments. Our outcomes were identification of secondary cases and close contacts, time to complete contact tracing, acceptability and accessibility issues, privacy and safety concerns, and any other ethical issue identified. Though modelling studies will predict estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest, cohort studies provide empirically measured estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest. We used GRADE‐CERQual to describe certainty of evidence from qualitative data and GRADE for modelling and cohort studies. Main results We identified six cohort studies reporting quantitative data and six modelling studies reporting simulations of digital solutions for contact tracing. Two cohort studies also provided qualitative data. Three cohort studies looked at contact tracing during an outbreak, whilst three emulated an outbreak in non‐outbreak settings (schools). Of the six modelling studies, four evaluated digital solutions for contact tracing in simulated COVID‐19 scenarios, while two simulated close contacts in non‐specific outbreak settings. Modelling studies Two modelling studies provided low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases using digital contact tracing (measured as average number of secondary cases per index case ‐ effective reproductive number ( R   eff )). One study estimated an 18% reduction in  R   eff  with digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact‐tracing. Another found a reduction in  R   eff  for digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in  R   eff  for manual contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (53% reduction). However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%). Cohort studies Two cohort studies provided very low‐certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing. During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms. Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio‐frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13. The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts. One cohort study provided very low‐certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias. Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss. Two studies from lower‐ or middle‐income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems; they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms. However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems. Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users. However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices. Authors' conclusions The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real‐world outbreak settings. Modelling studies provide low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self‐isolation. Cohort studies provide very low‐certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions may have equity implications for at‐risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology. Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real‐world settings. Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity. Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies. Plain language summary Are digital contact tracing technologies effective during infectious disease outbreaks? Why is this question important? The global COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the importance of accurate and timely contact tracing. Contact tracing tells people that they may have been near someone with ‐ or showing symptoms of ‐ an infectious disease, allowing them to self‐isolate and helping to stop the spread of infection. Traditionally, contact tracing begins with notification that someone has an infectious disease. They are asked to recall their contacts, going back two to three days before symptom onset. This is time‐consuming and may not always give a complete picture, so digital aids could help contact tracers. Digital contact tracing uses technology to track and trace contacts. Individuals download an app onto their smartphones and record location and symptom information, or their devices might use location‐finding technology, like Bluetooth or GPS (global positioning system). If the user is infected, the technology identifies close contacts and/or secondary infections (people to whom they passed the disease), and informs people whom they have been near. The technology identifies where the infection was passed on and its duration (the context). However, problems may occur where access to technology is limited, in low‐income settings or for elderly people, for example. Also, some people see it as an invasion of privacy and are suspicious of how their data will be used. We wanted to know whether digital contact tracing, compared to manual contact tracing, is effective in reducing the spread of infection, as measured by secondary infections, identifying close contacts, tracing a complete set of contacts, and identifying the context of infection. What did we do? We searched medical databases for studies that assessed digital contact tracing. We preferred studies set during infectious disease outbreaks, which assessed real people in real time, but we included studies in any setting and of any design. To answer our question quickly, we shortened some steps of the Cochrane review process, however, we are confident in our conclusions. What we found We found 12 relevant studies. Six assessed the effectiveness of digital contact tracing on specific groups (cohorts) of people: three during an outbreak (Ebola in Sierra Leone; tuberculosis in Botswana; and whooping cough (pertussis) in USA); and three replicated an outbreak in schools to assess systems for identifying close contacts of participants. The remaining six were modelling studies, which simulated digital contact tracing. Main results Digital contact tracing with self‐isolation probably reduces the number of secondary infections, but not as much as manual contact tracing with self‐isolation (2 modelling studies). Digital contact tracing found more close contacts in two outbreaks than manual (2 studies in USA and Sierra Leone). Devices in non‐outbreak settings can identify more close contacts than self‐reported diaries or surveys. An app may reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts (1 study). Digital systems were faster to use than paper systems for recording new contacts and monitoring known contacts, and possibly less prone to data loss. Problems with system access (2 studies) included patchy network coverage, lack of data, technical problems and higher staff training needs. Contact tracers' personal expenses increased (1 study) due to travel and recharging phone batteries. Devices all appeared to protect diagnosed users from contacts, snoopers and authorities but one app's users were members of public health agencies. Studies recorded stolen hardware (second‐hand mobile phones); reported that paper forms were ""often lost"", and that digital data were password protected (2 studies) and encrypted (1 study). We found no evidence on contextual information and acceptability. What this means It is unlikely that digital technologies would be the sole method of contact tracing during an outbreak; they would probably be used alongside manual methods. Unfortunately, the technology is largely unproven in real‐world outbreak settings and none of our included studies assessed digital plus manual contact tracing with digital contact tracing alone. Our included studies assessed different technologies and used different methods from each other, so we are uncertain about their evidence. Governments that implement digital contact tracing should ensure that at‐risk populations are not disadvantaged and take privacy concerns into account.

Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant’s social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. Objectives The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self‐report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life.  Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full‐text articles. Data collection and analysis One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed‐effect meta‐analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. Main results We identified three cluster quasi‐randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID‐19 pandemic.  Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean difference (MD) −0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD −0.34, 95% CI −3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD −2.40, 95% CI −7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months' follow‐up (MD 0.41, 95% CI −0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months' follow‐up (MD −0.83, 95% CI −2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one‐year follow‐up, though this finding is imprecise (MD −2.04, 95% CI −3.98 to −0.10; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short‐Form 36‐question health survey (SF‐36), which consists of eight subscales that measure different aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no difference between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three‐month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI −5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD −7.66, 95% CI −24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD −7.18, 95% CI −16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI −8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD −3.25, 95% CI −15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD −3.60, 95% CI −9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02) and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI −2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Authors' conclusions Based on this review there is currently very uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of video call interventions to reduce loneliness in older adults. The review did not include any studies that reported evidence of the effectiveness of video call interventions to address social isolation in older adults. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain. Future research in this area needs to use more rigorous methods and more diverse and representative participants. Specifically, future studies should target older adults, who are demonstrably lonely or socially isolated, or both, across a range of settings to determine whether video call interventions are effective in a population in which these outcomes are in need of improvement. Plain language summary Video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older people Background Coronavirus (COVID‐19) is a new virus that has spread quickly throughout the world. Countries have introduced restrictions on people’s movement to protect them from COVID‐19, but an unwanted result is that older people may feel lonely and isolated, which may lead to poor mental and physical health. A video call is a phone call that uses an internet connection. Video calls allow callers to see – as well as hear – each other. This technology could help older people keep in touch with family and friends safely, and this may reduce their feelings of loneliness and social isolation. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if older people who used video calls felt less lonely than those who did not. We also looked at whether video calls affected symptoms of depression or quality of life. Our methods We looked for studies that randomly allocated older people to different groups to use either video calls, another method of keeping in touch, or no particular method (usual care), with the aim of examining their effects on loneliness or social isolation. For our review, we considered older people to be aged 65 years or above. We considered video calls to be calls made via the internet, using computers, tablets or smartphones. COVID‐19 is spreading rapidly, so we needed to answer this question quickly. This meant that we shortened some steps of the normal Cochrane Review process. Two review authors checked 25% of our search results for studies and one review author checked the remaining 75% of our results, where normally two review authors would check all the results. Similarly, only one review author collected data and assessed the quality of the studies, and a second review author checked this work. Results We included three studies, with 201 participants, in our review. All three studies took place in nursing homes in Taiwan between 2010 and 2020 and compared video calls to usual care. The evidence from these three studies suggests that video calls have little to no effect on loneliness after three, six or 12 months. There is also little to no difference in symptoms of depression after three or six months, although after a year, older people who used video calls may have had a small reduction in depression compared to those who received usual care. Similarly, video calls may make little to no difference to older people’s quality of life. Certainty of the evidence Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was limited because we found few studies with a small number of participants, and they either used unreliable methods or did not fully describe their methods. Also, all of the participants were in nursing homes, so our findings may not apply to older people living in other places, such as their own homes. Also, some of the participants may not have been feeling lonely or socially isolated. Conclusion Based on the current evidence, we are unable to say whether video calls help to reduce loneliness in older people. We need more studies, that use rigorous methods to investigate this question, and focus on older people who are lonely or socially isolated.

Ash, the residue from stoves and fires, is a material used for cleaning hands in settings where soap is not widely available. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of hand cleaning with ash compared with hand cleaning using soap or other materials for reducing the spread of viral and bacterial infections. Search methods On 26 March 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Selection criteria We included all types of studies, in any population, that examined hand cleaning with ash compared to hand cleaning with any other material. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and full texts, and one review author extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias, which another review author double‐checked. We used the ROBINS‐I tool for observational studies, we used RoB 2.0 for three interventional studies, and we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We planned to synthesise data with random‐effects meta‐analyses. Our prespecified outcome measures were overall mortality, number of cases of infections (as defined in the individual studies), severity of infectious disease, harms (as reported in the individual studies), and adherence. Main results We included 14 studies described in 19 records using eight different study designs, but only one randomised trial. The studies were primarily conducted in rural settings in low‐ and lower‐middle‐income countries. Six studies reported outcome data relevant to our review. A retrospective case‐control study and a cohort study assessed diarrhoea in children under the age of five years and self‐reported reproductive tract symptoms in women, respectively. It was very uncertain whether the rate of hospital contacts for moderate‐to‐severe diarrhoea in children differed between households that cleaned hands using ash compared with households cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; very low‐certainty evidence). Similarly, it was very uncertain whether the rate of women experiencing symptoms of reproductive tract infection differed between women cleaning hands with ash compared with cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.86; very low‐certainty evidence) or when compared with handwashing with water only or not washing hands (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.96; very low‐certainty evidence). Four studies reported on bacteriological counts after hand wash. We rated all four studies at high risk of bias, and we did not synthesise data due to methodological heterogeneity and unclear outcome reporting. Authors' conclusions Based on the available evidence, the benefits and harms of hand cleaning with ash compared with soap or other materials for reducing the spread of viral or bacterial infections are uncertain. Plain language summary Does cleaning hands with ash stop or reduce the spread of viral and bacterial infections compared with soap or other materials? Background Some infectious diseases are spread by airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes, which can infect people who touch contaminated skin or surfaces. Washing hands with soap and water may prevent these diseases from spreading. People with no soap may use other materials like ash, mud, soil with or without water, or water alone, to clean their hands. Hand cleaning with ash (the solid remains from cooking stoves and fires) might work by rubbing away or inactivating the virus or bacteria. However, chemicals in the ash could also damage the skin. If ash is an effective hand cleanser, it could reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID‐19) and other infectious diseases in low‐income areas where soap is not widely available. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether people who use ash for hand cleaning are more or less likely to catch infectious diseases than people who use soap, water, mud or soil, or who do not clean their hands. We also wanted to know whether using ash causes unwanted effects, like sore hands or a rash. Our methods We looked for studies that examined hand cleaning with ash compared with soap, mud, soil, water only or no hand cleaning. To answer our questions, the studies could include adults and children and take place anywhere. COVID‐19 is spreading rapidly, so we needed to answer this question quickly. This meant we shortened some steps of the normal Cochrane Review process. We could not find the full texts of five potentially relevant studies, or contact study authors for additional data. Although we searched several databases we may have missed some studies. We plan to include all relevant information in a future version of the review. Results We identified 14 studies that assessed ash for hand cleaning. Only one small study directly compared people chosen at random to use ash or soap or other materials (randomised studies produce the best evidence). The studies included people of all ages and mainly took place in low‐income, rural communities. Six studies provided information to help answer our question. One study investigated children who had been to hospital with diarrhoea compared with children who had not. Study authors looked at the hand washing area in the children’s houses to see how they cleaned their hands. They found that families that used ash for hand cleaning made a similar number of hospital visits for children with diarrhoea as those families that used soap. Another study investigated whether women with unusual vaginal itching or discharge were more likely to clean their hands with ash than women who had not experienced such symptoms. They found that women who used ash and water for hand cleaning were as likely to experience vaginal itching or discharge as those women who used soap. Four studies measured bacteria on hands after using ash, soap, water, mud or no hand cleaning. We are uncertain about the effect of ash compared with other materials for hand cleaning on bacteria on people’s hands because the studies used unreliable methods and their results were unclear. None of the studies provided information about the severity of infectious diseases, whether people used ash or another material consistently, the number of deaths, or unwanted effects due to hand cleaning with ash. Certainty of the evidence Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was limited because we found few studies; those we did find had unreliable methods and different kinds of participants, and none of the studies we found reliably examined whether participants got infections. Conclusion We are uncertain whether hand cleaning with ash compared with hand cleaning with soap, water, mud, soil or no hand cleaning stops or reduces the spread of viral or bacterial infections. We do not know if hand cleaning with ash causes unwanted effects.
