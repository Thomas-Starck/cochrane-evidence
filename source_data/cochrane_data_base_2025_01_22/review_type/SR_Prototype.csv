Consequently, there is a need to assess the varied unintended consequences associated with PHSM implemented in the school setting, for students, teachers, and school staff, as well as for families and the wider community. This is an update of a Cochrane scoping review first published in 2022. Objectives To comprehensively identify and summarise the published literature on the unintended consequences of public health and social measures implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. This will serve to identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future primary research and systematic reviews. It may also serve as a resource for future pandemic management. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science on 5 and 6 January 2023. We also searched two COVID‐19‐specific databases (Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease). Finally, we reviewed the included studies of all relevant systematic reviews and guidelines identified through the searches. Selection criteria We included studies that empirically assessed the impact of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. We imposed no restrictions with regard to the types of populations and specific interventions. Outcomes of interest were consequences that were measured or experienced, but not anticipated consequences. This review focused on real‐world evidence: empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed‐method studies were eligible for inclusion, but modelling studies were ineligible. Data collection and analysis The review was guided by a logic model. In line with the latest Cochrane effectiveness review of school measures to contain COVID‐19 and a conceptual framework of PHSM, this logic model distinguishes between measures to make contacts safer (related to individual protection and the physical environment), measures to reduce contacts (related to social interactions, movement, and services) and surveillance and response measures. Unintended consequences comprise the following categories: health and well‐being, health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, acceptability and adherence, equality and equity, social and institutional, economic and resource, and ecological. The review team screened all titles and abstracts, then potentially eligible full‐text articles, in duplicate. Across the included studies, we summarised and presented types of measures, consequences, and study designs using the predefined categories of the logic model, while allowing for emerging categories. Main results We included 60 studies (57 new to this update) from 25 countries. There were 31 quantitative studies, 17 qualitative studies, and 12 mixed‐method studies. Most targeted either students (26 studies), teachers and school staff (11 studies), or students and school staff (12 studies). Others evaluated measures aimed at parents (2 studies), staff and parents (1 study), students and teachers (3 studies), or the whole school (5 studies). The measures were related to individual protection (26 studies), the physical environment (20 studies), social interactions (25 studies), services (1 study), movement (3 studies), surveillance (9 studies) and response (7 studies). Nine studies evaluated the combined effect of multiple measures. The main consequences assessed were from the categories health and well‐being (29 studies), acceptability and adherence (31 studies), and social and institutional (23 studies). Fewer studies covered consequences from the categories equality and equity (2 studies), economic and resource (7 studies), and ecological (1 study). No studies examined consequences for the health system and social welfare services or for human and fundamental rights. Authors' conclusions This scoping review provides an overview of the evidence on the unintended consequences of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. The 60 included studies describe a broad body of evidence and cover a range of measures and unintended consequences, primarily consequences for health and well‐being, acceptability and adherence, social and institutional aspects, and economic aspects. The main gaps identified relate to consequences of school measures for the health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, equality and equity, and the environment. Further research is needed to fill these gaps, making use of diverse methodological approaches. Future studies should explore unintended consequences – whether beneficial or harmful – in more depth and over longer time periods, in different population groups, and across different contexts. A more robust evidence base could inform and facilitate decisions about whether, how, and when to implement or terminate COVID‐19 risk mitigation measures in school settings, and how to counter negative unintended consequences.

Registration The protocol is registered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/bsxh8). The previous review is published in the Cochrane Library (10.1002/14651858.CD015397). Plain language summary What were the unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic? Why is this question important? During the COVID‐19 pandemic, different measures were implemented in schools to help stop the virus spreading. These measures included changes to school rules or actions with the following goals. To reduce the spread of the virus when people were together To reduce the number of face‐to‐face contacts between people To test whether people had COVID‐19 To isolate those with COVID‐19 to prevent it spreading School measures like these can have both planned (intended) effects and unplanned (unintended) effects, which we need to monitor. For example, a rule to improve hand hygiene should lead to more handwashing (a planned effect) but could also lead to skin problems (an unplanned effect). These unplanned effects can be negative or positive, and can affect students, teachers, other school staff members, parents, and the wider community. What are school measures to help contain the COVID‐19 pandemic? We identified four types of school measures. Measures to make contacts safer. These work by reducing risk during face‐to‐face contact. Examples include mask wearing, ventilation, and hand hygiene. Measures to reduce the opportunity for contacts. These work by reducing face‐to‐face contact between students and others. One example is lowering the number of students in a classroom. Surveillance and response measures. These work by testing whether people have COVID‐19 and taking action to prevent it spreading, for example by isolating people who test positive. Multi‐component measures. These combine aspects of the above three types of measures. What did we want to find out? We aimed to find and describe evidence on the unplanned effects of school measures implemented to help contain the spread of COVID‐19. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at side effects of school measures. We grouped the side effects into the following categories. Physical and mental health and well‐being Health and social care services Human rights Acceptability of measures Unfair differences in health outcomes Civil life, social interactions, and education Money and resources The environment We summarised the available information on school measures and their side effects. What did we find? We included 60 studies from 25 countries. Regarding study design, 31 used numbers and statistics, 17 used text and descriptions, and 12 used both numbers and descriptions. Most studies looked at measures for staff (11 studies) or students (26 studies), or measures aimed at both staff and students or the whole school (20 studies). Only three studies looked at measures for parents or caregivers. The studies investigated the following measures in schools. Individual protection (26 studies); for example, wearing masks Changes to the physical environment (20 studies); for example, improving ventilation Rules about social interactions (25 studies); for example, mixing online and in‐person teaching Changes to services (1 study); for example, cancelling extracurricular activities Rules about movement (3 studies); for example, staying in class at break time Surveillance measures (9 studies); for example, testing students and teachers Response measures (7 studies); for example, isolating people with COVID‐19 Nine studies looked at the joint effects of more than one measure (for example, joint effects of wearing masks and improving ventilation). Most studies focused on the following unplanned effects. The influence of school measures on health and well‐being (29 studies) Whether school measures were acceptable or easy to carry out (31 studies) How school measures affected social interactions, school organisation, and education (23 studies) Other unplanned effects included the following. Changes to unfair differences in health outcomes (2 studies) Effects on money and resources (7 studies) Effects on the environment (1 study) What did we conclude? Most of the studies in the review looked at the influence of school measures on health and well‐being; social interactions, school organisation, and education; and whether measures were acceptable and easy to carry out. The most common school measures were wearing masks, cleaning and disinfecting rooms and surfaces, mixing online and in‐person learning, and ensuring physical distancing. Many studies also looked at combinations of several measures. This review identified the gaps, where more research is needed. We need more studies to look at a wider variety of unplanned effects. We also need more studies looking at the unplanned effects of other school measures, such as testing and response measures. Future studies should look at long‐term effects, too. We need more information about how these measures work in different types of schools and in different countries. This would help people make decisions about when and how to use different school measures. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to January 2023.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*COVID-19 [epidemiology, prevention & control, transmission]; *Pandemics [prevention & control]; *Schools; Child; Communicable Disease Control [methods]; Humans; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2; School Teachers","10.1002/14651858.CD015397.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015397.pub2","Central Editorial Service"
"CD016043","Umaefulam, V; Safi, S; Lingham, G; Gordon, I; Mueller, A; Krishnam, NS.; Alves Carneiro, V; Yu, M; Evans, JR; Keel, S","Approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2024","Abstract - Background Uncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment which, in most cases, can be managed with the appropriate spectacle correction. In 2021, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global target of a 40‐percentage‐point increase in effective coverage of refractive error by 2030. To achieve this global target, equitable access to refractive and optical services within community and primary care settings needs to be strengthened. This review will inform the development of technical guidance to support improvements in the testing and correction of refractive error among World Health Organization (WHO) member states. Objectives To determine the range of approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings, and the methods employed for their evaluation. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health databases, grey literature, and annual reports and websites of relevant organizations involved in eye‐care delivery from January 2002 to November 2022 to identify approaches for refractive and optical service delivery. Selection criteria We included observational and interventional studies, reviews, and reports from relevant organizations related to delivering refractive services and optical services for preschool and school‐aged children and adults in community and primary care settings published between January 2002 and November 2022. We searched for studies and reports published within the last 20 years because vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error has only recently become a public health and eye health priority, therefore we did not expect to find much relevant literature until after 2002. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts, and extracted data. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We synthesized data, and presented results as tables, figures, and case studies. This project was led by the World Health Organization (WHO) Vision and Eye Care Programme. Main results We identified 175 studies from searches of databases and grey literature, 146 records from company reports, and 81 records from website searches of relevant organizations that matched our inclusion criteria. Delivery approaches for refractive and optical services in community care included school‐based, pharmacy, and outreach models, whereas primary care approaches comprised vision centre, health centre, and a combination of vision or health centre and door‐to‐door delivery. In community care, school‐based and outreach approaches were predominant, while in primary care, a vision‐centre approach was mainly used. In the WHO African region, the school‐based and outreach approaches were mainly reported while, in the Americas, the outreach approach was mostly used. Very few approaches for service delivery were reported in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region. Prominent gaps exist in the evaluation of the approaches, and few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services. Authors' conclusions We comprehensively describe a range of approaches for delivery of refractive and optical services in community and primary care. Further evaluation of their effectiveness will better inform the application of these service‐delivery approaches. The study outcomes will help guide WHO member states in strengthening refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels. Funding This scoping review was supported by the Vision and Eye care Programme, World Health Organization and ATscale Global Partnership. Registration The protocol of this scoping review was published in the Open Source Framework. Plain language summary What are the different ways eye tests are carried out and spectacles provided in the community and in health clinics worldwide? Key messages 1. Outreach (a community‐based approach to provide eye care in various settings, which are often not permanent locations), and school‐based service delivery approaches were mainly used to provide eye care in the community, while vision centres were mainly used in primary care (first‐line health care). 2. In the World Health Organization (WHO) South‐East Asia region, eye care was most often delivered using outreach and vision centres, whereas in the African region, school‐based delivery and outreach were mainly reported. In the Americas, outreach was mostly used. 3. We need more information from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region, and we need research to evaluate which approaches are most effective. Why is it important to provide eye tests and spectacles? Many sight problems are easily solved by wearing spectacles (eye‐glasses). However, millions of people around the world don’t have access to the tests and facilities they need to get the correct spectacles. This is a problem for many people because eye care services may be expensive, or located far away. Poor vision can affect children’s ability to learn at school, and lead to people being unable to work. Governments, health services, eye care organizations, and charities use different approaches to provide eye care services to a wide variety of people. This might be by bringing services to people in the community or by providing accessible primary eye care services locally. What did we want to find out? The World Health Organization (WHO) is working on advice to countries to help them improve their eye care services. The first step is to understand what eye care services are currently available worldwide, where they are based, and how they work. This information allows us to find the gaps in the evidence, to see where future research should be focused, and will help with the WHO guidance. What did we do? We searched for evidence about the different ways people can access eye tests and get spectacles in the community and at local health centres or doctors’ clinics (primary care) anywhere in the world. We needed as much information as possible, so we gathered evidence from medical studies, and also from annual reports and websites of eye care organizations. We grouped the evidence according to the different ways eye tests and spectacles were provided, and we described how and where the services were delivered. What did we find? We found 175 studies, 146 records from eye care organizations and 81 records from websites (402 resources in total), which reported the ways eye care services were delivered in the community or in primary care. Most eye care services included eye tests, assessing the need for spectacles, and providing spectacles. The services were mainly carried out by eye care providers and sometimes with other people, like nurses, doctors and teachers. Community eye care services are provided where people live or work. Schools (154 resources): teachers are trained to give vision tests in school, or eye care workers visit the school to conduct tests. Sometimes a van or bus, equipped as an eye test centre, visits the school. Spectacles are usually prescribed if needed, and follow‐ups or referrals for further eye care can be arranged. Schools sometimes partner with community or primary healthcare centres to provide eye care services. Pharmacies (3 resources): community pharmacies provide vision tests and spectacles. Outreach (157 resources): eye care providers go out into the community to provide care, for example in workplaces or homes. Outreach services are not in a permanent place but may be somewhere for a short period. They often visit very remote areas. They may offer free eye tests and spectacles. In primary care, patients visit a permanent location to receive eye care services. Vision centres (53 resources) are eye care clinics staffed by trained eye care workers. They carry out tests and provide spectacles. Patients usually pay for spectacles, but they may get a voucher to help with the cost. Health centres (16 resources) are healthcare facilities but not eye care clinics. They usually provide eye tests and spectacles. Vision and health centres plus door‐to‐door delivery (11 resources): a combination of services provided by vision and health centres and home visits. In the WHO South‐East Asia region, the outreach and vision centre approaches were most common. In the WHO African region, the school‐based and outreach approaches were mainly reported. In the WHO Americas region, the outreach approach was mostly used. What are the limitations of the evidence? We found very few reports of how eye care services are delivered in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region, so our picture of services there is limited. There was limited information about how well the delivery methods worked, so more research is needed about this. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to November 2022.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Primary Health Care; *Refractive Errors [therapy]; Adult; Child; Community Health Services [organization & administration]; Delivery of Health Care [organization & administration]; Eyeglasses; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD016043","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD016043","Eyes and Vision"
"CD015385.PUB2","Richter, B; Bongaerts, B; Metzendorf, M-I","Thermal stability and storage of human insulin","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Health authorities stress the temperature sensitivity of human insulin, advising protection from heat and freezing, with manufacturers suggesting low‐temperature storage for intact vials, and once opened, storage at room temperature for four to six weeks, though usage time and maximum temperature recommendations vary. For human insulin, the recommendations of current shelf life in use may range from 10 to 45 days, and the maximum temperature in use varies between 25 °C and 37 °C. Optimal cold‐chain management of human insulin from manufacturing until the point of delivery to people with diabetes should always be maintained, and people with diabetes and access to reliable refrigeration should follow manufacturers' recommendations. However, a growing segment of the diabetes‐affected global population resides in challenging environments, confronting prolonged exposure to extreme heat due to the climate crisis, all while grappling with limited access to refrigeration. Objectives To analyse the effects of storing human insulin above or below the manufacturers' recommended insulin temperature storage range or advised usage time, or both, after dispensing human insulin to people with diabetes. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 12 July 2023. Selection criteria We included clinical and laboratory studies investigating the storage of human insulin above or below manufacturers' recommended temperature storage range, advised usage time, or both. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for the clinical study. Most information emerged from in vitro studies, mainly from pharmaceutical companies. There is no validated risk of bias and certainty of evidence rating for in vitro studies. We thus presented a narrative summary of the results. Main results We included 17 eligible studies (22 articles) and additional information from pharmaceutical companies. Pilot clinical study One pilot clinical study investigated temperature conditions for insulin stored for six weeks in an unglazed clay pot with temperatures ranging between 25 °C and 27 °C. The mean fall in plasma glucose in eight healthy volunteers after clay pot‐stored insulin injection was comparable to refrigerator‐stored insulin injection (very low‐certainty evidence). In‐vitro studies Nine, three and four laboratory studies investigated storage conditions for insulin vials, insulin cartridges/pens and prefilled plastic syringes, respectively. The included studies reported numerous methods, laboratory measurements and storage conditions. Three studies on prefilled syringes investigating insulin potency at 4 °C up to 23 °C for up to 28 days showed no clinically relevant loss of insulin activity. Nine studies examined unopened vials and cartridges. In studies with no clinically relevant loss of insulin activity for human short‐acting insulin (SAI), intermediate‐acting insulin (IAI) and mixed insulin (MI) temperatures ranged between 28.9 °C and 37 °C for up to four months. Two studies reported up to 18% loss of insulin activity after one week to 28 days at 37 °C. Four studies examined opened vials and cartridges at up to 37 °C for up to 12 weeks, indicating no clinically relevant reduction in insulin activity. Two studies analysed storage conditions for oscillating temperatures ranging between 25 °C and 37 °C for up to 12 weeks and observed no loss of insulin activity for SAI, IAI and MI. Four studies, two on vials (including one on opened vials), and two on prefilled syringes, investigated sterility and reported no microbial contamination. Data from pharmaceutical companies Four manufacturers (BIOTON, Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi) provided previously unreleased human insulin thermostability data mostly referring to unopened containers (vials, cartridges). We could not include the data from Sanofi because the company announced the permanent discontinuation of the production of human insulins Insuman Rapid, Basal and Comb 25. BIOTON provided data on SAI after one, three and six months at 25 °C: all investigated parameters were within reference values, and, compared to baseline, loss of insulin activity was 1.1%, 1.0% and 1.7%, respectively. Eli Lilly and Company provided summary data: at below 25 °C or 30 °C SAI/IAI/MI could be stored for up to 25 days or 12 days, respectively. Thereafter, patient in‐use was possible for up to 28 days. Novo Nordisk provided extensive data: compared to baseline, after three and six months at 25 °C, loss of SAI activity was 1.8% and 3.2% to 3.5%, respectively. Loss of IAI activity was 1.2% to 1.9% after three months and 2.0% to 2.3% after six months. Compared to baseline, after one, two and three months at 37 °C, loss of SAI activity was 2.2% to 2.8%, 5.7% and 8.3% to 8.6%, respectively. Loss IAI activity was 1.4% to 1.8%, 3.0% to 3.8% and 4.7% to 5.3%, respectively. There was no relevant increase in insulin degradation products observed. Up to six months at 25 °C and up to two months at 37 °C high molecular weight proteins were within specifications. Appearance, visible particles or macroscopy, particulate matter, zinc, pH, metacresol and phenol complied with specifications. There were no data for cold environmental conditions and insulin pumps. Authors' conclusions Under difficult living conditions, pharmaceutical companies' data indicate that it is possible to store unopened SAI and IAI vials and cartridges at up to 25 °C for a maximum of six months and at up to 37 °C for a maximum of two months without a clinically relevant loss of insulin potency. Also, oscillating temperatures between 25 °C and 37 °C for up to three months result in no loss of insulin activity for SAI, IAI and MI. In addition, ambient temperature can be lowered by use of simple cooling devices such as clay pots for insulin storage. Clinical studies on opened and unopened insulin containers should be performed to measure insulin potency and stability after varying storage conditions. Furthermore, more data are needed on MI, insulin pumps, sterility and cold climate conditions. Plain language summary Temperature and storage conditions for human insulin What is insulin? Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps your body turn food into energy and controls your blood sugar levels. People with diabetes cannot make enough insulin or use it effectively, so some have to inject it themselves. How should insulin be stored? Health authorities and pharmaceutical manufacturers recommend keeping insulin away from sunlight, not freezing it and storing it in a refrigerator. Unopened human insulin vials or flasks and cartridges for insulin pens should be stored at temperatures between 2 °C and 8 °C, which requires reliable refrigeration. Once opened, vials or cartridges can be stored at 'room temperature' and used for approximately four to six weeks. However, recommendations differ regarding usage time and maximum temperature once open (in‐use insulin). Also, advice varies for the type of insulin, brand, insulin concentrations and container (vial, cartridge/pen, insulin pump). Regulatory bodies guide how to handle insulin transport and storage temperature ('cold chain') from manufacturer to delivery to people with diabetes. If reliable refrigeration is available, people with diabetes should store insulin according to official recommendations. However, there is no clear consensus on how human insulin should be stored at home if reliable refrigeration cannot be guaranteed. What are the problems with insulin storage? Many people with diabetes live in settings with little access to healthcare facilities and refrigeration. Challenging locations affected by natural disasters, periods of extreme heat due to the climate crisis or war‐like conditions additionally complicate appropriate insulin storage. What did we want to find out? We wanted to analyse the effects of storing human insulin above or below the manufacturers' recommended insulin temperature or advised usage time, or both. What did we look for? We searched medical databases and contacted study authors and pharmaceutical manufacturers about studies on people with diabetes. We also looked for laboratory studies investigating the effects of storing human insulin above or below the manufacturers' recommended insulin temperature storage range or advised usage time, or both. What did we find? We found one clinical study. Nine, three and four laboratory studies investigated storage conditions for insulin vials, insulin cartridges and prefilled plastic insulin syringes, respectively. Key results In the clinical study, authors investigated insulin stored for six weeks in an unglazed clay pot or in a refrigerator. Outside temperatures were between 34 °C and 43 °C, and clay pot temperatures were between 25 °C and 27 °C. The study authors only reported on the glucose level in the blood of eight healthy volunteers after injecting clay‐pot‐stored insulin or refrigerator‐stored insulin. Insulin in the clay pot had similar glucose‐lowering activity to insulin in a refrigerator. Laboratory studies on prefilled syringes stored at 4 °C to 23 °C for up to 28 days showed no clinically relevant loss of insulin activity. Nine laboratory studies examined unopened vials and cartridges. In studies with no clinically relevant loss of insulin activity, temperatures ranged between 28.9 °C and 37 °C for up to four months. Two studies reported a more pronounced loss of insulin activity after one week to 28 days at 37 °C. Four studies examined opened vials and cartridges at up to 37 °C for up to 12 weeks, and showed no clinically relevant reduction in insulin activity. Two laboratory studies analysed storage conditions for shifting temperatures between 25 °C and 37 °C up to 12 weeks, resembling daytime and night‐time fluctuations in tropical countries. There was no loss of insulin activity for short‐acting, intermediate‐acting and mixed insulin (a combination of short‐acting and intermediate‐acting human insulin). Four laboratory studies, two on vials, one of them on opened vials, and two on prefilled syringes, investigated sterility and reported no bacterial contamination. Four manufacturers provided previously unpublished temperature and storage conditions data. If unopened human insulin vials or cartridges were stored at up to 25 °C for a maximum of six months or at up to 37 °C for a maximum of two months, only small amounts of insulin activity were lost. We could not include the provided data from the manufacturer Sanofi because the company announced the permanent discontinuation of the production of human insulins called Insuman Rapid, Basal and Comb 25. If no reliable refrigeration is possible, room temperature can be lowered using simple cooling devices such as clay pots for insulin storage. There were no data for cold environmental conditions or insulin pumps. What are the limitations of the evidence? Data on the quality of human insulin in unopened vials and cartridges appeared reliable. However, most data came from laboratory studies, and we were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because there are currently no validated methods for doing so. More studies should investigate the possible bacterial contamination risk of in‐use insulin vials and cartridges. Also, clinical studies in particular are needed to inform on temperature and storing conditions for insulin outside the official recommendations. How up to date is this review?

However, patients with compromised immune status develop a weaker and less stable immune response to vaccination. Strong immune response may not always translate into clinical benefit, therefore it is important to synthesise evidence on modified schemes and types of vaccination in these population subgroups for guiding health decisions. As the literature on COVID‐19 vaccines continues to expand, we aimed to scope the literature on multiple subgroups to subsequently decide on the most relevant research questions to be answered by systematic reviews. Objectives To provide an overview of the availability of existing literature on immune response and long‐term clinical outcomes after COVID‐19 vaccination, and to map this evidence according to the examined populations, specific vaccines, immunity parameters, and their way of determining relevant long‐term outcomes and the availability of mapping between immune reactivity and relevant outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, the Web of Science Core Collection, and the World Health Organization COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 6 December 2021.  Selection criteria We included studies that published results on immunity outcomes after vaccination with BNT162b2, mRNA‐1273, AZD1222, Ad26.COV2.S, Sputnik V or Sputnik Light, BBIBP‐CorV, or CoronaVac on predefined vulnerable subgroups such as people with malignancies, transplant recipients, people undergoing renal replacement therapy, and people with immune disorders, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children. We included studies if they had at least 100 participants (not considering healthy control groups); we excluded case studies and case series. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently and in duplicate onto an online data extraction form. Data were represented as tables and as online maps to show the frequency of studies for each item. We mapped the data according to study design, country of participant origin, patient comorbidity subgroup, intervention, outcome domains (clinical, safety, immunogenicity), and outcomes.  Main results Out of 25,452 identified records, 318 studies with a total of more than 5 million participants met our eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Participants were recruited mainly from high‐income countries between January 2020 and 31 October 2021 (282/318); the majority of studies included adult participants (297/318).  Haematological malignancies were the most commonly examined comorbidity group (N = 54), followed by solid tumours (N = 47), dialysis (N = 48), kidney transplant (N = 43), and rheumatic diseases (N = 28, 17, and 15 for mixed diseases, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively). Thirty‐one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The most commonly administered vaccine was BNT162b2 (N = 283), followed by mRNA‐1273 (N = 153), AZD1222 (N = 66), Ad26.COV2.S (N = 42), BBIBP‐CorV (N = 15), CoronaVac (N = 14), and Sputnik V (N = 5; no studies were identified for Sputnik Light). Most studies reported outcomes after regular vaccination scheme.  The majority of studies focused on immunogenicity outcomes, especially seroconversion based on binding antibody measurements and immunoglobulin G (IgG) titres (N = 179 and 175, respectively). Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported in 126 and 54 studies, whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 infection irrespective of severity was reported in 80 studies. Mortality due to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was reported in 36 studies. Please refer to our  evidence gap maps  for more detailed information. Authors' conclusions Up to 6 December 2021, the majority of studies examined data on mRNA vaccines administered as standard vaccination schemes (two doses approximately four to eight weeks apart) that report on immunogenicity parameters or adverse events. Clinical outcomes were less commonly reported, and if so, were often reported as a secondary outcome observed in seroconversion or immunoglobulin titre studies. As informed by this scoping review, two effectiveness reviews (on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients) are currently being conducted. Plain language summary Immunity in vulnerable groups after COVID‐19 vaccination What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which studies on the most commonly used COVID‐19 vaccines in vulnerable subgroups have been published, and which outcomes were reported (e.g. effectiveness outcomes, safety, or immune response), to decide on the most relevant questions and answer these in further effectiveness systematic reviews (syntheses of the medical literature). What did we do? We searched medical databases and trial registries for studies on COVID‐19 vaccines that were authorised for use in the European Union (European Medicines Agency (EMA)‐approved) and those approved in at least 10 countries worldwide at the time of our search. We included studies on additional conditions (comorbidities) that can reduce the immune reaction to vaccination, if they had more than 100 participants; they could include any age, sex, ethnicity, or country of recruitment. We excluded studies looking at the general population and other than preselected COVID‐19 vaccines and subgroups.  Once we found the studies, we categorised the vaccines into the following groups: EMA‐approved COVID‐19 vaccines, other COVID‐19 vaccines, and schemes with different COVID‐19 vaccines. We summarised the results in an interactive online map. We mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study design, and the vulnerable population. What did we find? We included 318 studies. Most studies came from high‐income countries and included adults. We found that haematological malignancies (cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes) and solid tumours were examined in many studies, followed by people receiving dialysis and kidney transplants, rheumatic diseases, and others. Thirty‐one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The majority of studies explored mRNA vaccines (N = 283 and N = 153 for BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273) at two doses, and EMA‐approved vaccines were more commonly administered than other vaccines and schemes with different COVID‐19 vaccines.  Outcomes related to immunogenicity (how well a vaccine works, or the ability to stimulate the development of antibodies), especially the presence or absence of antibodies in the blood of patients or an estimate for the amount of these antibodies, were the most frequently reported outcome in more than 170 studies each. In addition, adverse events were assessed often (N = 126 studies), whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was reported in only 80 studies. What are the limitations of the evidence? Due to the quick development of the pandemic, the research landscape may have changed. The newer Omicron variant has become the dominant variant, and a new vaccine has been approved by the EMA, which is not covered by our search. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021. What are the next steps? Based on the overview from this review, we have decided to conduct two detailed systematic reviews on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*COVID-19 [epidemiology, prevention & control]; *Hematologic Neoplasms; *Vaccines; Ad26COVS1; Adult; BNT162 Vaccine; COVID-19 Vaccines; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; Child; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination","10.1002/14651858.CD015021","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015021","Haematology"

Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine‐resistant mutations of SARS‐CoV‐2 may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID‐19 is limited. Different vaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries and poses a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review maps interventions aimed at increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy.  Objectives To scope the existing research landscape on interventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressed populations and intervention categories.   Search methods We searched Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021.  Selection criteria We included studies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs), observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants. Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. We did not limit the scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomes assessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines for diseases other than COVID‐19. Data collection and analysis Data were analysed according to a  protocol  uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used an interactive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mapped the identified interventions according to pre‐specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were: communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions, incentives (both financial and non‐financial), interventions to improve access, and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, the addressed population, and whether the design was randomised‐controlled or not.  Main results We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevant systematic reviews. For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   Studies with published results Of the 61 studies with published results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventions investigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testing communication strategies to enhance COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. Most studies assessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that were addressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  Ongoing studies Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs and six NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used types of interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptake as an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. In contrast to the studies with published results, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populations range from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students. Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022.   Authors' conclusions We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneous interventions for increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives a comprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and can be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.  A research gap was shown for studies conducted in low and middle‐income countries and studies investigating policy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressing children and adolescents. As COVID‐19 vaccines become more widely available, these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research. Plain language summary Interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake  Background Vaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. What was our aim? We wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.  Methods We searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.  Once we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. Results We included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID‐19.  Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.  A majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   Conclusion We identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID‐19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower‐middle‐income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.

People with COPD often live with one or more co‐existing long‐term health conditions (comorbidities). People with more severe COPD often have a higher number of comorbidities, putting them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention for people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. To assess the effectiveness of an adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) compared to usual care in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. To identify emerging themes that describe the views and experiences of patients, carers and healthcare professionals when receiving or providing care to manage multimorbidities (qualitative data). Search methods We searched multiple databases including the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify relevant randomised and qualitative studies. We also searched trial registries and conducted citation searches. The latest search was conducted in January 2021. Selection criteria Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared a) any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention, or b) any adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more comorbidities, compared to usual care. We included qualitative studies or mixed‐methods studies to identify themes. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods for analysis of the RCTs. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool for the RCTs and the CASP checklist for the qualitative studies. We planned to use the Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) to assess the risk of bias in mixed‐methods studies, but we found none. We used GRADE and CERQual to assess the quality of the quantitative and qualitative evidence respectively. The primary outcome measures for this review were quality of life and exacerbations. Main results Quantitative studies We included seven studies (1197 participants) in the quantitative analyses, with interventions including telemonitoring, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment optimisation, water‐based exercise training and case management. Interventions were either compared with usual care or with an active comparator (such as land‐based exercise training). Duration of trials ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Mean age of participants ranged from 64 to 72 years and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials included either people with COPD and a specific comorbidity (including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, lung cancer, head or neck cancer, and musculoskeletal conditions), or with one or more comorbidities of any type. Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of moderate to very low certainty (GRADE), mainly due to the methodological quality of included trials and imprecision of effect estimates. Intervention versus usual care Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care at 52 weeks (mean difference (MD) −10.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) −12.66 to −9.04; 1 study, 70 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Tailored pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks (MD −8.02, 95% CI −9.44 to −6.60; 1 study, 70 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention at 52 weeks (MD −6.90, 95% CI −9.56 to −4.24; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence is uncertain about effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.57; 1 study, 470 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). For secondary outcomes, six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions at 38 to 52 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital at 17 weeks, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention. There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for mortality. Intervention versus active comparator We included one study comparing water‐based and land‐based exercise (30 participants). We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise for 6MWD (MD 5 metres, 95% CI −22 to 32; 38 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Qualitative studies One nested qualitative study (21 participants) explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use. We judged the qualitative evidence presented as of very low certainty overall. Authors' conclusions Owing to a paucity of eligible trials, as well as diversity in the intervention type, comorbidities and the outcome measures reported, we were unable to provide a robust synthesis of data. Pulmonary rehabilitation or multicomponent interventions may improve quality of life and functional status (6MWD), but the evidence is too limited to draw a robust conclusion. The key take‐home message from this review is the lack of data from RCTs on treatments for people living with COPD and comorbidities. Given the variation in number and type of comorbidity(s) an individual may have, and severity of COPD, larger studies reporting individual patient data are required to determine these effects. Plain language summary Approaches to help people with COPD who have one or more long��term conditions What is COPD and comorbidity? COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. People with COPD may have one or more other long‐term conditions (comorbidities) such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and lung cancer which can lead to poor health. People living with two or more comorbidities can also be known as living with multimorbidity. Why did we do this review?  Because many people with COPD live with multimorbidity, naturally people in clinical trials will have multimorbidities. However, the results of those trials are usually not reported broken down by multimorbidity. People with comorbidities may need to adapt interventions to take account of their comorbidity — for example taking exercise in water instead of on land so that their bodies are better supported. Historically, Cochrane Airways Reviews have not taken into account people's comorbidities, and this review is a first step to addressing this. We decided to complete a review that centres on people with COPD and comorbidities following a meeting with our COPD patient group, who highlighted concerns over comorbidities. After some deliberation, we decided to include the following two sorts of trials. 1. Any single intervention for COPD delivered to people with COPD adapted to or targeting their comorbidity compared to routine care or any other intervention. 2. Any intervention aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and comorbidities, which could be simple (e.g. scheduling COPD and heart clinics on the same day) or more complex (e.g. developing a new care package for management of people with COPD across a local health service), compared to routine care. We wanted to know which treatments improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations for people living with COPD and one or more comorbidities. We also wanted to find out about how people with COPD, carers and health professionals felt about those treatments. What information did we find? We carried out a search for studies in January 2021. We found seven  eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1197 people, and one qualitative study which was part of one of the randomised trials and provided information about people's opinions and experiences of using telehealth equipment. People included in the trials were aged between 64 and 72 years, and their COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. The trials either included people with COPD and a specific comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer, or they included people with COPD and one or more other conditions of any sort. Results and conclusions There is not enough evidence on people with COPD and other comorbidities to draw firm conclusions about interventions aimed at COPD that are adapted for the comorbidity. The available evidence indicated the following:  ‐ Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (note that there is a strong evidence base for pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD). ‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve quality of life as measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention.  ‐ Evidence is uncertain about the effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. ‐ There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care.  ‐ For secondary outcomes, the distance walked by participants in six minutes may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions. A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention.  ‐ There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for deaths across several studies. ‐ One study compared water‐based exercise with land‐based exercise. We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise on the distance walked by participants in six minutes. ‐ One qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use.  Larger studies with more people with COPD and comorbidities could help to find out if targeted approaches can improve health. Certainty of the information Overall there were very few studies and most studies were small. This means the results are based on a small amount of information. Trials with different interventions and different or more people may give a different result.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Aged; Bias; Case Management; Cause of Death; Comorbidity; Confidence Intervals; Disease Progression; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Exercise; Humans; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive [epidemiology, mortality, rehabilitation, *therapy]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Severity of Illness Index; Telemedicine; Time Factors; Walk Test","10.1002/14651858.CD013384.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013384.pub2","Airways"

People with risk factors for or pre‐existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. Objectives To assess the prevalence of pre‐existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19. Search methods We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid‐19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. Selection criteria We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before‐and‐after, case‐control and cross‐sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer‐reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre‐print servers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta‐analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. Main results We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI’s critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI’s checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%)  are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID‐19, and are associated with an increased risk of death. In those admitted to hospital, biomarkers of cardiac stress or injury are often abnormal, and the incidence of a wide range of cardiovascular complications is substantial, particularly arrhythmias (22 studies, n = 13,115, weighted mean incidence (WMI) 9.3%), heart failure (20 studies, n = 29,317, WMI: 6.8%) and thrombotic complications (VTE: 16 studies, n = 7700, WMI: 7.4%). Authors' conclusions This systematic literature review indicates that cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in people who are hospitalised with a COVID‐19 infection, and cardiovascular complications are frequent. We plan to update this review and to conduct a formal meta‐analysis of outcomes based on a more homogeneous selected subsample of high‐certainty studies. Plain language summary What type of heart and blood vessel problems complicate COVID‐19 infections, how common are they and what other medical conditions do these patients have? Background Many people infected by COVID‐19 have few or no symptoms. However, COVID‐19 can make the blood ‘sticky’, clogging up both small blood vessels (capillaries) and large ones, which may cause heart attacks, strokes or blood clots in the legs or lungs. These can be fatal. People who have diabetes, high blood pressure or pre‐existing heart problems are at greater risk of developing such complications if they get COVID‐19. Our research question We wanted to find out, in cases of confirmed or suspected COVID‐19: ‐ what are the most common pre‐existing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems (for example, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity) ‐ what are the most common complications affecting the heart and blood vessels (for example, irregular heartbeat, blood clots, heart failure and stroke)  in different setting (in the community, care homes or in hospital). What we did We searched for published studies that reported heart and blood vessel problems in people with possible or confirmed COVID‐19. Studies could be of any design and could take place anywhere, but they had to have been checked by other researchers (be peer‐reviewed), be written in English, and include at least 100 cases. The evidence is current until July 2020. What we found We found 220 studies that reported relevant information, but the quality of the information was often poor. Studies were mostly from China and the USA. Most studies only had information on the small minority of cases that were admitted to hospital with COVID‐19, often to the intensive care unit. We found that high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease are very common in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 and are associated with an increased risk of death. More than one‐third of patients with COVID‐19 had a history of high blood pressure, 23.5% had a pre‐existing heart or blood vessel problem, 22.1% had diabetes, and 21.6% were obese (many people had more than one of these conditions). The most common cardiovascular complication in people with COVID‐19 was an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation; 8.5%). Blood clots in the legs (6.1%) or lungs (4.3%), and heart failure (6.8%) were also common, but the reported rates may be underestimated because the studies did not always carry out appropriate investigations. Heart attacks (1.7%) and strokes (1.2%) were reported less often. Blood tests also often suggested heart damage or stress. Next steps The studies focused on people in hospital, with severe COVID‐19, so the results may not apply to people who had milder COVID‐19 who were not hospitalised. The studies were very different from each other and did not always report the results in the same way or use the most reliable methods. Accordingly, our confidence in the precision of the prevalence of pre‐existing disease and of cardiovascular complications is not high. We plan to update this review. However, in future, we will focus only on higher‐quality evidence to increase the strength of our findings.

Evaluating ICU care, and what is effective in improving outcomes for these patients is critical. Care bundles, a small set of evidence‐based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To identify the extent of the available evidence on the use of care bundles in patients with COVID‐19 in the ICU, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a scoping review to inform WHO guideline discussions. This review does not assess the effectiveness of the findings, assess risk of bias, or assess the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). As this review was commissioned to inform guideline discussions, it was done rapidly over a three‐week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. Objectives To identify and describe the available evidence on the use of care bundles in the ICU for patients with COVID‐19 or related conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) viral pneumonia or pneumonitis), or both. In carrying out the review the focus was on characterising the evidence base and not evaluating the effectiveness or safety of the care bundles or their component parts. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 26 October 2020. Selection criteria Studies of all designs that reported on patients who are critically ill with COVID‐19, ARDS, viral pneumonia or pneumonitis, in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was implemented in providing care, were eligible for inclusion. One review author (VS) screened all records on title and abstract. A second review author (DR) checked 20% of excluded and included records; agreement was 99.4% and 100% respectively on exclude/include decisions. Two review authors (VS and DR) independently screened all records at full‐text level. VS and DR resolved any disagreements through discussion and consensus, or referral to a third review author (AN) as required. Data collection and analysis One review author (VS) extracted the data and a second review author (DR) checked 20% of this for accuracy. As the review was not designed to synthesise effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterise the certainty of the evidence (GRADE), we mapped the extracted data and presented them in tabular format based on the patient condition; that is patients with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19, patients with ARDS, patients with any influenza or viral pneumonia, patients with severe respiratory failure, and patients with mixed conditions. We have also provided a narrative summary of the findings from the included studies . Main results We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were of variable designs and included a systematic review of standardised approaches to caring for critically ill patients in ICU, including but not exclusive to care bundles (1 study), a randomised trial (1 study), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (4 studies), before and after studies (7 studies), observational quality improvement reports (4 studies), case series/case reports (3 studies) and audit (1 study). The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China (5 studies) and the USA (4 studies), were published between 1999 and 2020, and involved over 2000 participants in total. Studies categorised participant conditions patients with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 (7 studies), patients with ARDS (7 studies), patients with another influenza or viral pneumonia (5 studies), patients with severe respiratory failure (1 study), and patients with mixed conditions (1 study). The care bundles described in the studies involved multiple diverse practices. Guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies) and prone positioning (7 studies) were identified most frequently, while only one study mentioned chest X‐ray. None of the included studies reported the prespecified outcomes ICU‐acquired weakness (muscle wasting, weight loss) and users' experience adapting care bundles. Of the remaining prespecified outcomes, 14 studies reported death in ICU, nine reported days of ventilation (or ventilator‐free days), nine reported length of stay in ICU in days, five reported death in hospital, three reported length of stay in hospital in days, and three reported adherence to the bundle. Authors' conclusions This scoping review has identified 21 studies on care bundle use in critically ill patients in ICU with COVID‐19, ARDS, viral influenza or pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. The data for patients with COVID‐19 specifically are limited, derived mainly from observational quality improvement or clinical experiential accounts. Research is required, urgently, to further assess care bundle use and optimal components of these bundles in this patient cohort. The care bundles described were also varied, with guidance on ventilator settings described in 10 care bundles, while chest X‐ray was part mentioned in one care bundle in one study only. None of the studies identified in this scoping review measured users' experience of adapting care bundles. Optimising care bundle implementation requires that the components of the care bundle are collectively and consistently applied. Data on challenges, barriers and facilitators to implementation are needed. A formal synthesis of the outcome data presented in this review and a critical appraisal of the evidence is required by a subsequent effectiveness review. This subsequent review should further explore effect estimates across the included studies. Plain language summary What evidence is there that care bundles improve outcomes for patients with COVID‐19 in the intensive care setting? What are care bundles? Care bundles are a set of care practices that are carried out together (as a bundle) when delivering care to patients with the same condition or in the same healthcare setting. There are usually three to five practices in a bundle. Practices could include any aspect of patient care. For example, a bundle might include guidance on inserting breathing tubes, ventilator settings and care of ventilated patients. All the practices are ‘evidence‐based’, that is, they are based on evidence that shows they are useful. Why might care bundles help? Some people with COVID‐19 can become seriously ill and need intensive care. They will require respiratory (breathing) support and may need to be placed on a ventilator. Recent information suggests that around 26% of people with COVID‐19 around the world have been admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and of these people, almost one‐third have died. For people with COVID‐19 and related conditions (such as viral pneumonia, which also causes serious breathing difficulties), using care bundles will mean that practitioners carry out each care practice in the bundle, each time. Implementing the practices together, rather than individually, should result in better outcomes for patients. Use of care bundles should also reduce variation in how care is delivered and can improve the teamwork needed to provide high‐quality health care, which also results in better patient outcomes. Purpose of the review The World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned this 'scoping' review to identify how much and what type of evidence is available on the use of care bundles for patients in the ICU setting suffering from COVID‐19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or viral pneumonia. We wanted to identify and describe the studies that have been done and what they assessed, but not to appraise their quality or analyse their findings as we would usually do in a standard review. The WHO wanted to use this review to help develop their guidelines, so we prepared it quickly, over a three‐week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. How did we identify and map the evidence? We searched for all types of studies that reported on patients who were seriously ill with COVID‐19, ARDS or viral pneumonia in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was used. Study participants could be any age. The care bundles could include any practices, but there had to be at least three in a bundle, they had to be evidence‐based, and delivered together in the same way each time. We grouped the studies according to their participants' health condition: confirmed or suspected COVID‐19; ARDS; viral pneumonia; severe respiratory failure; and patients with a variety of these conditions. What did we find? We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China and the USA, and were published between 1999 and 2020. Over 2000 participants in total were involved in the studies. Seven studies included patients with COVID‐19, seven with ARDS, five with viral pneumonia, one with severe respiratory failure and one with a mixture of conditions. The descriptions of the care bundles were varied, but most involved care practices related to breathing support or ventilator settings, or the positioning of a patient (e.g. face down), for ARDS and COVID‐19. COVID‐19‐specific studies also focused on infection control and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Some care bundles were specific to parts of the body such as eye or skin care. Some of the 'evidence gaps' we identified were a lack of care bundles focused on preparing patients to leave the ICU, preventing infections caused by giving medicines intravenously (by drip), and the long‐term effects of COVID‐19. None of the studies looked at healthcare workers' experience of adapting care bundles. Authors' conclusions Information specific to patients with COVID‐19 that compares patients receiving care bundles and not receiving care bundles is limited, and more research is needed. We also need information on how care bundles can best be implemented in practice, and the difficulties that might be associated with this. A separate review that assesses the quality of the evidence that we found in this review, and that combines and analyses the data, is required","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Critical Care; *SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19 [complications, epidemiology, *therapy]; Humans; Influenza, Human [therapy]; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Patient Care Bundles [*methods]; Pneumonia, Viral [therapy]; Respiratory Distress Syndrome [therapy]; Respiratory Insufficiency [therapy]; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD013819","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013819","Emergency and Critical Care"

While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA‐ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. Objectives To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. Selection criteria We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, or developing COVID‐19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed‐methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission‐related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health‐related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. Data collection and analysis We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). Main results We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi‐experimental designs. Studies conducted in real‐world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission‐related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. Authors' conclusions We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic. Plain language summary Which school‐based measures designed to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic have been evaluated to date, and how were they evaluated? Why is this question important? To combat the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, countries worldwide have taken a variety of public health measures. In many countries, shutting schools was one of the earliest responses. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. This severely disrupted school, family and work life, with likely negative impacts including: ‐ a worsening of children’s and adolescents’ health and well‐being; ‐ increases in inequalities between children and adolescents from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds; ‐ possible decreased parental income and job security; ‐ possible loss of parental economic productivity. Given the potential negative consequences of school closures, many countries have since reopened schools. To avoid disease transmission among students, between staff and students, and beyond, a range of school‐based measures have been put in place. These include: ‐ students and staff wearing face masks and regularly washing their hands; ‐ adapting school activities (for example, not singing in music classes); ‐ improving ventilation systems; and ‐ screening suspected cases of infection. To date, we know little about which school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated, and how they have been evaluated. It is important to find this out, so that, in time, we can compare the effectiveness of different measures and inform future policy guidelines. We set out to identify and map the evidence on school‐based measures to contain COVID‐19. This work is intended to form the basis of a future review about the effectiveness of these measures. This review will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). How did we identify and map the evidence? First, we searched for studies that evaluated any intervention set in schools designed to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. We considered all types of studies, and a broad range of outcomes, including: ‐ infectious disease transmission; ‐ other harmful or beneficial effects on health; ‐ wider implications for society, the economy, and the population. We then grouped studies according to how similar or different they were. This allowed us to gauge: ‐ which types of study have been used to evaluate measures to date; ‐ where studies have been conducted; ‐ which types of intervention have been evaluated; and ‐ which outcomes have been studied. What did we find? We found 42 studies. Type of study Thirty‐one studies used mathematical modelling designs, to predict the effects of measures on populations. Two studies used experimental designs, in which researchers divide people or settings into groups to compare the effects of different measures. Nine studies used observational designs, in which researchers simply observed the effect of the intervention. Study setting Studies were conducted in Europe (20 studies), North and South America (13 studies), the West Pacific (6 studies), and the Eastern Mediterranean (1 study). Most studies evaluated measures in more than one school setting (for example, primary education and secondary education). Three studies focused on secondary schools. Type of intervention Studies evaluated three broad types of measure: 1. Organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (36 studies): these included: ‐ measures designed to limit risks of disease transmission between people who come into contact with each other (such as face‐masks and physical distancing policies); and ‐ measures to reduce opportunities for contact (for example, staggered arrival, break and departure times). 2. Structural or environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (11 studies): for example, dividing up school playgrounds or improving air circulation. 3. Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (19 studies): these included: ‐ testing, tracing, and symptom screening; and ‐ isolation of confirmed cases or quarantine of suspected cases. Outcomes studied Studies assessed the effects of measures on: ‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (29 studies), including the number of new cases or the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass the virus (reproduction number R); ‐ healthcare use (8 studies), for example, the number of hospitalizations; ‐ other health outcomes (3 studies), for example, the risk of developing hand eczema (a skin condition); and ‐ societal, economic, and other population‐level outcomes (5 studies), including cost. What are the implications of our findings? A wide range of school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated to date. To evaluate these, researchers have used different methods and investigated different outcomes. This review is an important first step in gauging what evidence is available, and will inform future rapid reviews on this topic.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*SARS-CoV-2; Administrative Personnel; COVID-19 [*epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Humans; Pandemics [*prevention & control]; School Teachers; Schools [*organization & administration]; Students","10.1002/14651858.CD013812","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013812","Public Health"

Advocacy may help women who are in, or have left, an abusive intimate relationship, to stop or reduce repeat victimisation and overcome consequences of the abuse. Advocacy primarily involves education, safety planning support and increasing access to different services. It may be stand‐alone or part of other services and interventions, and may be provided within healthcare, criminal justice, social, government or specialist domestic violence services. We focus on the abuse of women, as interventions for abused men require different considerations. Objectives To assess advocacy interventions for intimate partner abuse in women, in terms of which interventions work for whom, why and in what circumstances. Search methods In January 2019 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 12 other databases, two trials registers and two relevant websites. The search had three phases: scoping of articles to identify candidate theories; iterative recursive search for studies to explore and fill gaps in these theories; and systematic search for studies to test, confirm or refute our explanatory theory. Selection criteria Empirical studies of any advocacy or multi‐component intervention including advocacy, intended for women aged 15 years and over who were experiencing or had experienced any form of intimate partner abuse, or of advocates delivering such interventions, or experiences of women who were receiving or had received such an intervention. Partner abuse encompasses coercive control in the absence of physical abuse. For theory development, we included studies that did not strictly fit our original criteria but provided information useful for theory development. Data collection and analysis Four review authors independently extracted data, with double assessment of 10% of the data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. We adopted RAMESES (Realist and meta‐narrative evidence syntheses: evolving standards) standards for reporting results. We applied a realist approach to the analysis. Main results We included 98 studies (147 articles). There were 88 core studies: 37 focused on advocates (4 survey‐based, 3 instrument development, 30 qualitative focus) and seven on abused women (6 qualitative studies, 1 survey); 44 were experimental intervention studies (some including qualitative evaluations). Ten further studies (3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 1 intervention process evaluation, 1 qualitative study, 2 mixed methods studies, 2 surveys of women, and 1 mixed methods study of women and staff) did not fit the original criteria but added useful information, as befitting a realist approach. Two studies are awaiting classification and three are ongoing. Advocacy interventions varied considerably in contact hours, profession delivering and setting. We constructed a conceptual model from six essential principles based on context‐mechanism‐outcome (CMO) patterns. We have moderate and high confidence in evidence for the importance of considering both women's vulnerabilities and intersectionalities and the trade‐offs of abuse‐related decisions in the contexts of individual women's lives. Decisions should consider the risks to the woman's safety from the abuse. Whether actions resulting from advocacy increase or decrease abuse depends on contextual factors (e.g. severity and type of abuse), and the outcomes the particular advocacy intervention is designed to address (e.g. increasing successful court orders versus decreasing depression). We have low confidence in evidence regarding the significance of physical dependencies, being pregnant or having children. There were links between setting (high confidence), and potentially also theoretical underpinnings of interventions, type, duration and intensity of advocacy, advocate discipline and outcomes (moderate and low confidence). A good therapeutic alliance was important (high confidence); this alliance might be improved when advocates are matched with abused women on ethnicity or abuse experience, exercise cultural humility, and remove structural barriers to resource access by marginalised women. We identified significant challenges for advocates in inter‐organisational working, vicarious traumatisation, and lack of clarity on how much support to give a woman (moderate and high confidence). To work effectively, advocates need ongoing training, role clarity, access to resources, and peer and institutional support. Our provisional model highlights the complex way that factors combine and interact for effective advocacy. We confirmed the core ingredients of advocacy according to both women and advocates, supported by studies and theoretical considerations: education and information on abuse; rights and resources; active referral and liaising with other services; risk assessment and safety planning. We were unable to confirm the impact of complexity of the intervention (low confidence). Our low confidence in the evidence was driven mostly by a lack of relevant studies, rather than poor‐quality studies, despite the size of the review. Authors' conclusions Results confirm the core ingredients of advocacy and suggest its use rests on sound theoretical underpinnings. We determined the elements of a good therapeutic alliance and how it might be improved, with a need for particular considerations of the factors affecting marginalised women. Women's goals from advocacy should be considered in the contexts of their personal lives. Women's safety was not necessarily at greatest risk from staying with the abuser. Potentially, if undertaken for long enough, advocacy should benefit an abused woman in terms of at least one outcome providing the goals are matched to each woman's needs. Some outcomes may take months to be determined. Where abuse is severe, some interventions may increase abuse. Advocates have a challenging role and must be supported emotionally, through provision of resources and through professional training, by organisations and peers. Future research should consider the different principles identified in this review, and study outcomes should be considered in relation to the mechanisms and contexts elucidated. More longitudinal evidence is needed. Single‐subject research designs may help determine exactly when effect no longer increases, to determine the duration of longitudinal work, which will likely differ for vulnerable and marginalised women. Further work is needed to ascertain how to tailor advocacy interventions to cultural variations and rural and resource‐poor settings. The methods used in the included studies may, in some cases, limit the applicability and completeness of the data reported. Economic analyses are required to ascertain if resources devoted to advocacy interventions are cost‐effective in healthcare and community settings. Plain language summary A review of which advocacy interventions work to help abused women, and under what circumstances, and which women are likely to benefit Background Partner abuse (domestic violence) is common worldwide. It includes coercive control, physical, sexual, economic, emotional and/or economic abuse. Trained people, known as advocates, can actively support abused women to make safety plans, cope with and take steps to reduce the abuse, and access community resources. This is known as advocacy. Advocacy can take many forms. Review question We wished to understand which advocacy interventions work to help abused women, under what circumstances, and which women may benefit. This is called a realist approach. It assumes that we often develop a superficial knowledge of how something happens (e.g. how advocacy works), based on simple measurements and observations. A realist approach tries to understand what is really happening at a deeper level by exploring different effects in different conditions. Methods We searched scientific literature worldwide up to January 2019 for any relevant studies. Key findings We found 98 studies from 15 countries. Of the 88 core studies, 37 asked advocates about their views and experiences and seven asked abused women about advocacy (two of these also asked staff). The other 44 core studies helped us understand the way advocacy works and how effective it is. We included 10 additional studies that did not fit the original criteria but added useful information, as befitting a realist approach. Of these, three were randomised controlled trials (RCTs; a type of experiment in which participants are randomly allocated to two or more interventions), one was an intervention process evaluation, one was a qualitative (e.g. focus groups, interviews) study, two studies used mixed methods (a combination of qualitative and quantitative research) to explore women's experiences, two were surveys of women, and one was a mixed methods study of women and staff. We were unable to obtain the full texts of two studies that we thought might be core and three further relevant studies are still ongoing. Advocacy interventions varied considerably in duration, participating staff (e.g. nurses, psychologists, social workers), and setting (e.g. healthcare settings, domestic violence refuges or shelters). In the studies, women and advocates agreed that the following were all important parts of advocacy: education and information on abuse and on women's rights and sources of help (resources); active referral to, and help in accessing other services; assessment of risk of repeat abuse; and safety planning to avoid it. Trust in the advocate is important and more likely when the advocate and the woman share an ethnic background or the advocate was also abused. Advocates must help women consider their best options, depending on things like ethnicity, immigration status, where they live, the severity and type of the abuse experienced and finances. There are trade‐offs when making decisions to reduce the abuse and women's safety was not necessarily at greatest risk from staying with the abuser. Advocacy could potentially have some benefits for abused women, if undertaken for long enough, but its goals need to match each woman's needs. It may take months to have an effect. Two studies (one involving the police and one in an antenatal clinic) found that where abuse is severe to start with, some interventions may possibly prompt the abuser to increase the abuse. Advocates want to help women and can get stressed if they do not feel helpful enough, so they need support from organisations and other advocates, including repeat training, debriefs, and funding to do their job well. Quality of the evidence Our confidence in the key findings varied between moderate and high. However, some themes (the effect on outcomes of women being physically dependent on their abuser, being pregnant or having children) were less well supported by evidence and further, good‐quality research is needed to confirm findings. Researchers should be careful when choosing how to measure abuse so that measures have more meaning for advocates and abused women, thus increasing the usefulness of future reviews. Further evidence from studies where participants are followed up for years would be helpful. More economic analyses are needed to establish if current advocacy interventions are the best way of spending money for abused women.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Crime Victims [economics, education, psychology]; *Patient Advocacy [education]; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Qualitative Research; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Safety; Spouse Abuse [economics, *prevention & control, psychology]; Surveys and Questionnaires","10.1002/14651858.CD013135.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013135.pub2","Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems"
