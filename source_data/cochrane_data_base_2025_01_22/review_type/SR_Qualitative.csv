Individuals with experience of migration may encounter difficulties with or barriers to these steps that may, in turn, lead to poorer health outcomes than those of the general population. Moreover, women and men have different health challenges and needs and may respond differently to interventions aimed at improving health literacy. In this review, we use 'gender' rather than 'sex' to discuss differences between men and women because gender is a broad term referring to roles, identities, behaviours and relationships associated with being male or female. Objectives The overall objective of this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) was to explore and explain probable gender differences in the health literacy of migrants. The findings of this QES can provide a comprehensive understanding of the role that any gender differences can play in the development, delivery and effectiveness of interventions for improving the health literacy of female and male migrants. This qualitative evidence synthesis had the following specific objectives: ‐ to explore whether there are any gender differences in the health literacy of migrants; ‐ to identify factors that may underlie any gender differences in the four steps of health information processing (access, understand, appraise, and apply); ‐ to explore and explain gender differences found ‐ or not found ‐ in the effectiveness of health literacy interventions assessed in the effectiveness review that is linked to this QES (Baumeister 2023); ‐ to explain ‐ through synthesising findings from Baumeister 2023 and this QES ‐ to what extent gender‐ and migration‐specific factors may play a role in the development and delivery of health literacy interventions. Search methods We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase until May 2021. We searched trial registries and conference proceedings. We conducted extensive handsearching and contacted study authors to identify all relevant studies. There were no restrictions in our search in terms of gender, ethnicity or geography. Selection criteria We included qualitative trial‐sibling studies directly associated with the interventions identified in the effectiveness review that we undertook in parallel with this QES. The studies involved adults who were first‐generation migrants (i.e. had a direct migration experience) and used qualitative methods for both data collection and analysis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data into a form that we developed specifically for this review. We assessed methodological limitations in the studies using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) Qualitative Studies) checklist. The data synthesis approach that we adopted was based on ""best fit"" framework synthesis. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our level of confidence in each finding. We followed PRISMA‐E guidelines to report our findings regarding equity. Main results We included 27 qualitative trial‐sibling studies directly associated with 24 interventions assessed in a linked effectiveness review (Baumeister 2023), which we undertook in parallel with this QES. Eleven studies included only women, one included only men and 15 included both. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Canada and primarily included people of Latino/Latina and Hispanic origin. The second most common origin was Asian (e.g. Chinese, Korean, Punjabi). Some studies lacked information about participant recruitment and consideration of ethical aspects. Reflexivity was lacking: only one study contained a reflection on the relationship between the researcher and participants and its impact on the research. None of the studies addressed our primary objective. Only three studies provided findings on gender aspects; these studies were conducted with women only. Below, we present findings from these studies, with our level of confidence in the evidence added in brackets. Accessing health information We found that 'migrant women of Korean and Afghan origin preferred access to a female doctor' (moderate confidence) for personal reasons or due to cultural norms. Our second finding was that 'Afghan migrant women considered their husbands to be gatekeepers', as women of an Afghan background stressed that, in their culture, the men were the heads of the household and the decision‐makers, including in personal health matters that affected their wives (low confidence). Our third finding was 'Afghan migrant women reported limited English proficiency' (moderate confidence), which impeded their access to health information and services. Understanding health information Female migrants of Afghan background reported limited writing and reading abilities, which we termed 'Afghan migrant women reported low literacy levels' (moderate confidence). Applying health information Women of Afghan and Mexican backgrounds stated that the 'women's role in the community' (moderate confidence) prevented them from maintaining their own health and making themselves a priority; this impeded applying health information. Appraising health information We did not find any evidence related to this step in health information processing. Other findings In the full text of this QES, we report on migration‐specific factors in health literacy and additional aspects related to health literacy in general, as well as how participants assessed the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in our linked effectiveness review. Moreover, we synthesised qualitative data with findings of the linked effectiveness review to report on gender‐ and migration‐specific aspects that need to be taken into account in the development, design and delivery of health literacy interventions. Authors' conclusions The question of whether gender differences exist in the health literacy of migrants cannot be fully answered in this qualitative evidence synthesis. Gender‐specific findings were presented in only three of the 27 included studies. These findings represented only Afghan, Mexican and Korean women's views and were probably culturally‐specific. We were unable to explore male migrants' perceived health literacy due to the notable lack of research involving migrant men. Research on male migrants' perceived health literacy and their health‐related challenges is needed, as well as more research on potential gender roles and differences in the context of migration. Moreover, there is a need for more research in different countries and healthcare systems to create a more comprehensive picture of health literacy in the context of migration. Plain language summary Are there differences between migrant women and men in how they access, understand, appraise and apply health information? Key messages ‐ A full exploration of whether differences exist between migrant women and men in how they access, understand, appraise and apply health information was not possible, particularly due to there being very little research with migrant men. ‐ Three studies conducted with migrant women indicated that particular gender roles in different communities and cultures can influence how health information is accessed, understood and applied. What did we want to find out? Our primary goal was to find out whether there are differences in how migrant (i.e. having moved to live in a foreign country) women and men access, understand, appraise and apply health information. To help us understand the evidence, we used an approach called the 'best fit framework' and a model known as 'health literacy information processing'. The four steps of health information processing ‐ the ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health information ‐ are what we define as a person's 'health literacy'. What did we do? We were interested in qualitative studies (e.g. studies where people share their opinions and perspectives on a certain health topic through interviews or group discussions). We conducted another review alongside this one to find out the effectiveness of different interventions to improve the health literacy of migrant women and men. We then integrated the findings of that review with this one to explain to what extent gender‐ and migration‐specific factors may play a role in the development and delivery of health literacy interventions. For this qualitative review, we searched for qualitative studies that were directly related to the interventions in the linked effectiveness review. We were interested in studies that were conducted alongside the effectiveness studies. These were studies that explored the perceptions and opinions of people from different cultural backgrounds on a certain health topic to help develop an intervention, or explore their experiences with an intervention that they had participated in. We used the four steps of the health information processing model (described above) to guide our synthesis of these data. We also assessed the quality of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as adequacy and relevance. What did we find? We included 27 studies. Eleven studies included only women, one study included only men, and 15 studies included both women and men. The age of study participants ranged from 26 to 87 years. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Canada and primarily included people of Latino/Latina/Hispanic origin (e.g. from the Caribbean, Central America or South America). The second most common origin of people was Asian (e.g. Chinese, Korean, Punjabi). The length of time participants had been living in the new country ranged from one month up to 38 years. Three studies of migrant women provided evidence on aspects that were related to migrant women, some of which also indicated differences between women and men. Regarding accessing health information, migrant women of Afghan and Korean background in two studies preferred access to a female rather than a male doctor for personal reasons, such as feelings of shame or humiliation, or due to cultural norms. Another finding regarding access was the perception of husbands as gatekeepers; women of Afghan background mentioned that in their culture, men are the head of the household and decision‐maker in the household, including about personal health matters that affect the women. Our third finding about access was that Afghan women's limited English proficiency impeded their access to health information and services. Regarding understanding health information, we identified low literacy levels amongst Afghan women as they reported limited ability in writing and reading. We did not find any evidence about the third step of health information processing ‐ appraising health information. Regarding applying health information, women of Mexican and Afghan background stated that the role of women in the community prevented them from maintaining their own health and making themselves a priority; this impeded applying health information. What are the limitations of the evidence? We rated our confidence in the evidence as moderate. We had minor to very minor concerns regarding methodological limitations in the studies, but serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the evidence as the evidence on gender aspects stems from only three studies and those studies included women only. We were not able to explore migrant men's health literacy due to the lack of research involving men. We suggest that more research on male migrants' perceived health literacy and their health‐related challenges is needed, particularly to explore potential differences between women and men. Moreover, there is a need for more research in different countries and healthcare systems to create a more comprehensive picture of aspects of health literacy in the context of migration. How up to date is this evidence? We searched for studies electronically until May 2021. We conducted handsearching and contacted study authors until September 2022.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Health Literacy; *Qualitative Research; *Transients and Migrants [psychology]; Female; Humans; Male; Sex Factors","10.1002/14651858.CD013302.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013302.pub2","Central Editorial Service"

One such solution is to use their personal mobile phones or other mobile devices in ways that are unregulated by their workplace. This can help them carry out their work when their workplace lacks functional formal communication and information systems, but it can also lead to new challenges. Objectives To explore the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers and other professionals working in healthcare services regarding their informal, innovative uses of mobile devices to support their work. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus on 11 August 2022 for studies published since 2008 in any language. We carried out citation searches and contacted study authors to clarify published information and seek unpublished data. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed‐methods studies with a qualitative component. We included studies that explored healthcare workers’ views, experiences, and practices regarding mobile phones and other mobile devices, and that included data about healthcare workers’ informal use of these devices for work purposes. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using an extraction form designed for this synthesis, assessed methodological limitations using predefined criteria, and used a thematic synthesis approach to synthesise the data. We used the ‘street‐level bureaucrat’ concept to apply a conceptual lens to our findings and prepare a line of argument that links these findings. We used the GRADE‐CERQual approach to assess our confidence in the review findings and the line‐of‐argument statements. We collaborated with relevant stakeholders when defining the review scope, interpreting the findings, and developing implications for practice. Main results We included 30 studies in the review, published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high‐, middle‐ and low‐income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets. We have moderate to high confidence in the statements in the following line of argument. The healthcare workers in this review, like other ‘street‐level bureaucrats’, face a gap between what is expected of them and the resources available to them. To plug this gap, healthcare workers develop their own strategies, including using their own mobile phones, data and airtime. They also use other personal resources, including their personal time when taking and making calls outside working hours, and their personal networks when contacting others for help and advice. In some settings, healthcare workers' personal phone use, although unregulated, has become a normal part of many work processes. Some healthcare workers therefore experience pressure or expectations from colleagues and managers to use their personal phones. Some also feel driven to use their phones at work and at home because of feelings of obligation towards their patients and colleagues. At best, healthcare workers’ use of their personal phones, time and networks helps humanise healthcare. It allows healthcare workers to be more flexible, efficient and responsive to the needs of the patient. It can give patients access to individual healthcare workers rather than generic systems and can help patients keep their sensitive information out of the formal system. It also allows healthcare workers to communicate with each other in more personalised, socially appropriate ways than formal systems allow. All of this can strengthen healthcare workers' relationships with community members and colleagues. However, these informal approaches can also replicate existing social hierarchies and deepen existing inequities among healthcare workers. Personal phone use costs healthcare workers money. This is a particular problem for lower‐level healthcare workers and healthcare workers in low‐income settings as they are likely to be paid less and may have less access to work phones or compensation. Out‐of‐hours use may also be more of a burden for lower‐level healthcare workers, as they may find it harder to ignore calls when they are at home. Healthcare workers with poor access to electricity and the internet are less able to use informal mobile phone solutions, while healthcare workers who lack skills and training in how to appraise unendorsed online information are likely to struggle to identify trustworthy information. Informal digital channels can help healthcare workers expand their networks. But healthcare workers who rely on personal networks to seek help and advice are at a disadvantage if these networks are weak. Healthcare workers’ use of their personal resources can also lead to problems for patients and can benefit some patients more than others. For instance, when healthcare workers store and share patient information on their personal phones, the confidentiality of this information may be broken. In addition, healthcare workers may decide to use their personal resources on some types of patients, but not others. Healthcare workers sometimes describe using their personal phones and their personal time and networks to help patients and clients whom they assess as being particularly in need. These decisions are likely to reflect their own values and ideas, for instance about social equity and patient 'worthiness'. But these may not necessarily reflect the goals, ideals and regulations of the formal healthcare system. Finally, informal mobile phone use plugs gaps in the system but can also weaken the system. The storing and sharing of information on personal phones and through informal channels can represent a ‘shadow IT’ (information technology) system where information about patient flow, logistics, etc., is not recorded in the formal system. Healthcare workers may also be more distracted at work, for instance, by calls from colleagues and family members or by social media use. Such challenges may be particularly difficult for weak healthcare systems. Authors' conclusions By finding their own informal solutions to workplace challenges, healthcare workers can be more efficient and more responsive to the needs of patients, colleagues and themselves. But these solutions also have several drawbacks. Efforts to strengthen formal health systems should consider how to retain the benefits of informal solutions and reduce their negative effects. Plain language summary What are healthcare workers' views, experiences and practices regarding their informal use of personal mobile phones to support their work? Key messages •  Healthcare workers sometimes use their personal mobile (or 'cell') phones informally to plug gaps in the healthcare system. •  Our findings suggest that this can help them work more efficiently. It can also help them be more responsive to patients and health workers' needs. •  However, it can also lead to problems for patients and healthcare workers, and it can weaken the healthcare system. What is informal mobile phone use? Healthcare workers sometimes use their personal mobile phones at work even though this use is not formally regulated. This may help them carry out their work when their workplace lacks effective and accessible ways of sharing information through the formal system. But it can also lead to new problems. What did we want to find out? We wanted to explore healthcare workers’ informal use of personal mobile phones to support their work. What did we do? We searched for studies about healthcare workers’ views, experiences, and practices regarding their personal mobile phone use at work. We analysed their results and assessed our confidence in the review findings. What did we find? We found 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high‐, middle‐ and low‐income countries. They explored different types of healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, lay‐health workers, pharmacists and healthcare managers working in hospitals, clinics and the community. Some of our review findings were only based on small amounts of data, which lowered our confidence in these findings. We have moderate to high confidence in the following review findings. • Healthcare workers are faced with the gap between what is expected of them and the resources available to them. To plug this gap, they develop their own strategies. This sometimes involves using their own mobile phones, data and airtime. They also use their personal time to make and take calls outside working hours, and use their personal networks to contact others for help and advice. • In some settings, healthcare workers’ personal mobile phone use is unregulated but has become a normal part of many work processes. Some healthcare workers, therefore, feel pressure from colleagues and managers to use their personal phones. Some also use their mobile phones because of feelings of obligation towards their patients and colleagues. • Healthcare workers’ use of their personal mobile phones, time and networks helps humanise healthcare. It allows healthcare workers to be more flexible, efficient and responsive to the needs of the patient. It can connect patients with individual healthcare workers rather than impersonal systems and can help patients keep sensitive information out of the formal system. It also allows healthcare workers to communicate with each other in more personal ways than formal systems allow. All this can strengthen healthcare workers' relationships with patients and colleagues. • However, these informal approaches can also cause problems for healthcare workers. Personal mobile phone use costs money. This is a particular problem for lower‐level healthcare workers and healthcare workers in low‐income settings who are likely to be paid less and may have less access to work phones or compensation. Out‐of‐hours use may also be more of a burden for lower‐level healthcare workers as they may find it harder to ignore calls when they are at home. Healthcare workers with poor access to electricity and the internet are also less able to use informal mobile phone solutions, while healthcare workers with less education may find it difficult to appraise the information they find online. Informal digital channels can help healthcare workers expand their personal networks. However, healthcare workers who rely on personal networks to seek help and advice are at a disadvantage if these networks are weak. • Healthcare workers’ use of their personal resources can also lead to problems for patients and can benefit some patients more than others.

People with bipolar disorder report lower levels of physical activity than the general population, and are at greater risk of chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease and obesity. These contribute to poor health outcomes. Physical activity has the potential to improve quality of life and physical and mental well‐being. Objectives To identify the factors that influence participation in physical activity for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder from the perspectives of service users, carers, service providers, and practitioners to help inform the design and implementation of interventions that promote physical activity. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and eight other databases to March 2021. We also contacted experts in the field, searched the grey literature, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed‐methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that focused on the experiences and attitudes of service users, carers, service providers, and healthcare professionals towards physical activity for bipolar disorder. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined questions. We used the ""best fit"" framework synthesis based on a revised version of the Health Belief Model to analyse and present the evidence. We assessed methodological limitations using the CASP Qualitative Checklist. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) guidance to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each finding to identify factors to inform the practice of health and care professionals and the design and development of physical activity interventions for people with bipolar disorder. Main results We included 12 studies involving a total of 592 participants (422 participants who contributed qualitative data to an online survey, 170 participants in qualitative research studies). Most studies explored the views and experiences of physical activity of people with experience of bipolar disorder. A number of studies also reported on personal experiences of physical activity components of lifestyle interventions. One study included views from family carers and clinicians. The majority of studies were from high‐income countries, with only one study conducted in a middle‐income country. Most participants were described as stable and had been living with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for a number of years. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate or low confidence, as some findings were based on only small amounts of data, and the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, questioning the relevance of these findings to other settings. We also had very few perspectives of family members, other carers, or health professionals supporting people with bipolar disorder. The studies did not include any findings from service providers about their perspectives on supporting this aspect of care. There were a number of factors that limited people's ability to undertake physical activity. Shame and stigma about one's physical appearance and mental health diagnosis were discussed. Some people felt their sporting skills/competencies had been lost when they left school. Those who had been able to maintain exercise through the transition into adulthood appeared to be more likely to include physical activity in their regular routine. Physical health limits and comorbid health conditions limited activity. This included bipolar medication, being overweight, smoking, alcohol use, poor diet and sleep, and these barriers were linked to negative coping skills. Practical problems included affordability, accessibility, transport links, and the weather. Workplace or health schemes that offered discounts were viewed positively. The lack of opportunity for exercise within inpatient mental health settings was a problem. Facilitating factors included being psychologically stable and ready to adopt new lifestyle behaviours. There were positive benefits of being active outdoors and connecting with nature. Achieving balance, rhythm, and routine helped to support mood management. Fitting physical activity into a regular routine despite fluctuating mood or motivation appeared to be beneficial if practised at the right intensity and pace. Over‐ or under‐exercising could be counterproductive and accelerate depressive or manic moods. Physical activity also helped to provide a structure to people's daily routines and could lead to other positive lifestyle benefits. Monitoring physical or other activities could be an effective way to identify potential triggers or early warning signs. Technology was helpful for some. People who had researched bipolar disorder and had developed a better understanding of the condition showed greater confidence in managing their care or providing care to others. Social support from friends/family or health professionals was an enabling factor, as was finding the right type of exercise, which for many people was walking. Other benefits included making social connections, weight loss, improved quality of life, and better mood regulation. Few people had been told of the benefits of physical activity. Better education and training of health professionals could support a more holistic approach to physical and mental well‐being. Involving mental health professionals in the multidisciplinary delivery of physical activity interventions could be beneficial and improve care. Clear guidelines could help people to initiate and incorporate lifestyle changes. Authors' conclusions There is very little research focusing on factors that influence participation in physical activity in bipolar disorder. The studies we identified suggest that men and women with bipolar disorder face a range of obstacles and challenges to being active. The evidence also suggests that there are effective ways to promote managed physical activity. The research highlighted the important role that health and care settings, and professionals, can play in assessing individuals' physical health needs and how healthy lifestyles may be promoted. Based on these findings, we have provided a summary of key elements to consider for developing physical activity interventions for bipolar disorder. Plain language summary Factors that influence physical activity in bipolar disorder Key messages We found few studies that explored factors that influence participation in physical activity for people with bipolar disorder. The studies we found suggested that regular physical activity can be beneficial for people with bipolar disorder, but there are some obstacles and challenges to as well as effective ways of promoting being active. What was the aim of this synthesis? The aim of this qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore the factors that promote physical activity for people with bipolar disorder. We searched for and analysed qualitative studies of views and experiences of people with bipolar disorder, health professionals, and family/carer perspectives. We included 12 studies involving a total of 592 participants (422 participants who contributed qualitative data to an online survey, 170 from qualitative studies). What was studied in this synthesis? Many people with bipolar disorder have physical health problems, and increasing physical activity may help improve their physical and mental well‐being. We studied qualitative research (research that gathers participants' experiences, beliefs, and behaviour) that aimed to promote physical activity for bipolar disorder and sought views from service users, health professionals, and family/carers. The review authors, who are researchers and/or health professionals working in the area of mental health and physical activity, identified this review topic because of limited research published in the area. What are the main findings of this synthesis? We included 12 studies conducted in Europe, North and South America, and Australia. Eleven studies were based in high‐income countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Spain, the UK, and the USA), and one was from a middle‐income country (Brazil). Most studies explored the views and experiences of physical activity in people with bipolar disorder. There were more women than men in the included research, and participants were described as stable with regard to their disease and interested in making lifestyle changes to improve their health. We downgraded our confidence from high to moderate or low confidence because some findings were based on small amounts of data or on studies from only a few countries, questioning how applicable these findings are to other settings. There were also very few perspectives from family members, other carers, or health professionals. There were no findings from service providers. In general, people had limited knowledge of the benefits of physical activity for managing mental health symptoms and of their physical health needs. Many people experienced shame and stigma about their physical and mental health, which contributed to anxiety and embarrassment and negative ways of coping, such as socially isolating. Taking medication, being overweight, smoking, and sleep were challenges to being more active. Lack of time and money, bad weather, poor transport, and personal safety concerns were also highlighted as problems. Tackling the sharp reduction in activity levels when young people leave education is a significant public health issue, particularly for young women. Workplace or healthcare schemes were considered beneficial. Being psychologically ready to be active and having social support and encouragement was helpful. People enjoyed connecting with nature and making social connections, and reported other benefits including weight loss, improved quality of life, and better mood regulation. Finding an enjoyable physical activity and incorporating it into a regular routine at the right level and intensity contributed to mood management and improved well‐being. Offering safe, accessible, inclusive, and low‐cost opportunities to be active could help reduce stigma and promote physical activity and social connections. Clearer guidelines about the benefits of physical activity should inform health and care treatment plans, and involving teams across fields of speciality with knowledge and experience in bipolar disorder could help support people to increase physical activity levels. Adjustments and support may need to be made to establish a beneficial activity programme and balanced routine. Interventions that take a phased, step‐by‐step approach to introduce lifestyle changes, for example increasing physical activity, healthy eating, and reducing risk behaviours (e.g. stopping smoking), are practical and effective. More research is required to establish the views and experiences of family members and carers and health and care professionals, as well as people who do not feel ready to engage in physical activity.

ACF may improve access to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment for the poor and for people remote from diagnostic and treatment facilities. As a result, ACF may also reduce onward transmission. However, there is a need to understand how these programmes are experienced by communities in order to design appropriate services. Objectives To synthesize community views on tuberculosis active case finding (ACF) programmes in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and eight other databases up to 22 June 2023, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We did not include grey literature. Selection criteria This review synthesized qualitative research and mixed‐methods studies with separate qualitative data. Eligible studies explored community experiences, perceptions, or attitudes towards ACF programmes for tuberculosis in any endemic low‐ or middle‐income country, with no time restrictions. Data collection and analysis Due to the large volume of studies identified, we chose to sample studies that had 'thick' description and that investigated key subgroups of children and refugees. We followed standard Cochrane methods for study description and appraisal of methodological limitations. We conducted thematic synthesis and developed codes inductively using ATLAS.ti software. We examined codes for underlying ideas, connections, and interpretations and, from this, generated analytical themes. We assessed the confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual approach, and produced a conceptual model to display how the different findings interact. Main results We included 45 studies in this synthesis, and sampled 20. The studies covered a broad range of World Health Organization (WHO) regions (Africa, South‐East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and the Americas) and explored the views and experiences of community members, community health workers, and clinical staff in low‐ and middle‐income countries endemic for tuberculosis. The following five themes emerged. • ACF improves access to diagnosis for many, but does little to help communities on the edge.  Tuberculosis ACF and contact tracing improve access to health services for people with worse health and fewer resources (High confidence). ACF helps to find this population, exposed to deprived living conditions, but is not sensitive to additional dimensions of their plight (High confidence) and out‐of‐pocket costs necessary to continue care (High confidence). Finally, migration and difficult geography further reduce communities' access to ACF (High confidence). • People are afraid of diagnosis and its impact.  Some community members find screening frightening. It exposes them to discrimination along distinct pathways (isolation from their families and wider community, lost employment and housing). HIV stigma compounds tuberculosis stigma and heightens vulnerability to discrimination along these same pathways (High confidence). Consequently, community members may refuse to participate in screening, contact tracing, and treatment (High confidence). In addition, people with tuberculosis reported their emotional turmoil upon diagnosis, as they anticipated intense treatment regimens and the prospect of living with a serious illness (High confidence). • Screening is undermined by weak health infrastructure.  In many settings, a lack of resources results in weak services in competition with other disease control programmes (Moderate confidence). In this context of low investment, people face repeated tests and clinic visits, wasted time, and fraught social interaction with health providers (Moderate confidence). ACF can create expectations for follow‐up health care that it cannot deliver (High confidence). Finally, community education improves awareness of tuberculosis in some settings, but lack of full information impacts community members, parents, and health workers, and sometimes leads to harm for children (High confidence). • Health workers are an undervalued but important part of ACF.  ACF can feel difficult for health workers in the context of a poorly resourced health system and with people who may not wish to be identified. In addition, the evidence suggests health workers are poorly protected against tuberculosis and fear they or their families might become infected (Moderate confidence). However, they appear to be central to programme success, as the humanity they offer often acts as a driving force for retaining people with tuberculosis in care (Moderate confidence). • Local leadership is necessary but not sufficient for ensuring appropriate programmes.  Local leadership creates an intrinsic motivation for communities to value health services (High confidence). However, local leadership cannot guarantee the success of ACF and contact tracing programmes. It is important to balance professional authority with local knowledge and rapport (High confidence). Authors' conclusions Tuberculosis active case finding (ACF) and contact tracing bring a diagnostic service to people who may otherwise not receive it, such as those who are well or without symptoms and those who are sick but who have fewer resources and live further from health facilities. However, capturing these 'missing cases' may in itself be insufficient without appropriate health system strengthening to retain people in care. People who receive a tuberculosis diagnosis must contend with a complex and unsustainable cascade of care, and this affects their perception of ACF and their decision to engage with it. Plain language summary What do people think of strategies to identify cases of tuberculosis in low‐ and middle‐income countries? What is active case finding? Active case finding (ACF) involves health workers going out into communities to identify people with tuberculosis who otherwise might not have sought help in clinics (e.g. because they live too far from health facilities or cannot afford to get there). The aim of ACF is to find people who have tuberculosis and provide them with treatment, in order to reduce the spread of disease and improve the health of infected people. What did we want to find out? We aimed to understand the experiences and perspectives of people who had been involved in ACF, including people with tuberculosis, community members, and health workers. What did we find? We included 45 studies and sampled from 20 across a broad range of World Health Organization (WHO) regions (Africa, South‐East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and the Americas). From these data, we drew the following five main conclusions. •  ACF improves access to diagnosis for many, but does little to help the poorest people.  ACF improves access to health services for people with worse health and fewer resources. However, programmes are not always sensitive to the challenges people have in their daily lives. Those who migrate for work or who live in remote areas also have little access to ACF. •  People are afraid of diagnosis and its impact.  Being targeted for screening is frightening. It exposes people to discrimination due to stigma, and people may also assume they have HIV. For this reason, some people may refuse to participate in diagnosis and treatment. In addition, people report feeling overwhelmed and afraid upon diagnosis, as they anticipate medicine side effects and the prospect of living with a serious illness. •  Screening is undermined by weak health infrastructure.  In many settings, lack of investment has resulted in poor services. As a result, people face repeated tests and clinic visits, wasted time, and difficult interactions with health workers. People with tuberculosis or other conditions who attend screening expect follow‐up care, which they may or may not receive. Finally, community members, parents, and health workers often receive inadequate information, which can lead to harm for children. •  Health workers are an under‐valued but important part of ACF.  ACF can feel difficult for health workers due to lack of support. They are also poorly protected against tuberculosis and fear that they or their families might become infected. Despite these obstacles, the care and support provided by health workers helps people feel able to manage their condition. •  Local leadership is necessary but not sufficient for ensuring appropriate programmes.  When people from the local community promote or conduct ACF, it increases support for the service. However, health workers need to balance professional authority with local knowledge and rapport. How up to date is this evidence?

Although there is a growing evidence base on the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of Hospital at Home, health service managers, health professionals and policy makers require evidence on how to implement and sustain these services on a wider scale. Objectives (1) To identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative research evidence on the factors that influence the implementation of Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home and Early Discharge Hospital at Home, from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including policy makers, health service managers, health professionals, patients and patients’ caregivers. (2) To explore how our synthesis findings relate to, and help to explain, the findings of the Cochrane intervention reviews of Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home and Early Discharge Hospital at Home services. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus and Scopus until 17 November 2022. We also applied reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. We searched for studies in any language. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed‐methods studies with qualitative data collection and analysis methods examining the implementation of new or existing Hospital at Home services from the perspective of different stakeholders. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected the studies, extracted study characteristics and intervention components, assessed the methodological limitations using the Critical Appraisal Skills Checklist (CASP) and assessed the confidence in the findings using GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research). We applied thematic synthesis to synthesise the data across studies and identify factors that may influence the implementation of Hospital at Home. Main results From 7535 records identified from database searches and one identified from citation tracking, we included 52 qualitative studies exploring the implementation of Hospital at Home services (31 Early Discharge, 16 Admission Avoidance, 5 combined services), across 13 countries and from the perspectives of 662 service‐level staff (clinicians, managers), eight systems‐level staff (commissioners, insurers), 900 patients and 417 caregivers. Overall, we judged 40 studies as having minor methodological concerns and we judged 12 studies as having major concerns. Main concerns included data collection methods (e.g. not reporting a topic guide), data analysis methods (e.g. insufficient data to support findings) and not reporting ethical approval. Following synthesis, we identified 12 findings graded as high (n = 10) and moderate (n = 2) confidence and classified them into four themes: (1) development of stakeholder relationships and systems prior to implementation, (2) processes, resources and skills required for safe and effective implementation, (3) acceptability and caregiver impacts, and (4) sustainability of services. Authors' conclusions Implementing Admission Avoidance and Early Discharge Hospital at Home services requires early development of policies, stakeholder engagement, efficient admission processes, effective communication and a skilled workforce to safely and effectively implement person‐centred Hospital at Home, achieve acceptance by staff who refer patients to these services and ensure sustainability. Future research should focus on lower‐income country and rural settings, and the perspectives of systems‐level stakeholders, and explore the potential negative impact on caregivers, especially for Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home, as this service may become increasingly utilised to manage rising visits to emergency departments. Plain language summary Multiple perceptions about implementing hospital at home Key messages ‐ When developing a Hospital at Home service, it is important to set up a straightforward process for healthcare professionals to refer patients. This includes producing clear guidelines that set out who the service is suitable for. ‐ Hospital at Home services need a trained workforce with skills to deliver safe and effective patient‐centred care in the home, with clear and consistent communication between staff, patients and caregivers. ‐ We propose a number of questions for use by healthcare professionals and managers when introducing new Hospital at Home services, or running existing services. The questions are intended to help plan for and implement Hospital at Home services and improve satisfaction and outcomes for staff, patients and caregivers. What is Hospital at Home? Hospital at Home provides hospital‐level care at home, for people who would otherwise be inpatients in hospital. One type of Hospital at Home is to avoid admission to hospital. This is called Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home. These services replace an admission to hospital, for people whose condition would normally need treatment in a hospital bed, for example for a flare‐up of a lung condition. Instead, a doctor can refer a patient they assess as being suitable to receive treatment for an illness in their own home (or the place where they usually live, including in residential care), for a limited time. Another type is called Early Discharge Hospital at Home. These services shorten the length of time people need to stay in hospital after being admitted as an inpatient, for example following surgery or treatment for an illness or condition. The care patients would usually receive from healthcare professionals in a hospital bed is instead provided in their home, and is not expected to compromise the quality of care. What did we want to find out? Our aim was to find out what is important when introducing, running and receiving care from Hospital at Home services. We wanted to explore a range of experiences of, and views on, Admission Avoidance and Early Discharge services. These might include things that managers want to know when planning to set up a Hospital at Home service, healthcare professionals’ views on working in a Hospital at Home service, what matters to patients who receive this type of care, or how family and caregivers experience Hospital at Home services for those they care for. What did we do? We searched for research that had explored experiences, attitudes or beliefs about Hospital at Home services from the perspectives of patients, caregivers, health professionals, managers and health funders. The studies addressed existing Hospital at Home services and those that were being set up, for people with a range of conditions, such as stroke, pneumonia or following surgery. The studies used interviews or focus groups to explore the views of people involved in delivering or receiving Hospital at Home services. We assessed and summarised the findings from each of the studies. We identified important findings across the studies, and then rated how confident we were in each finding. This confidence (or trust) depended on, for example, how much information relating to a particular finding had been provided in the studies. What did we find? We found 52 studies that explored Hospital at Home services, including 31 Early Discharge, 16 Admission Avoidance and five combined Early Discharge and Admission Avoidance services. These studies conducted interviews or focus groups with 662 healthcare staff, 900 patients, 417 caregivers and eight health funders. In total, we identified 12 main findings after assessing all the studies. We grouped these findings as: (1) development of stakeholder relationships and systems prior to implementation, (2) processes, resources and skills required for safe and effective delivery, (3) acceptability and caregiver impacts and (4) sustainability of services. We are confident in most of our findings, but we are less confident in a few findings, mainly due to the small numbers of studies and interviews with health funders contributing to the review finding. What are the limitations of the evidence? All except one of the studies came from high‐income countries, and so our findings may not apply to low‐ and middle‐income countries. Some studies did not report all the information that might be useful. For example, services’ staffing and role types were not always included. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to November 2022.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hospitalization; *Patient Discharge; Administrative Personnel; Checklist; Hospitals; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD014765.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014765.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

It is possible to prevent complications of PPH with timely and appropriate detection and management. However, implementing the best methods of PPH prevention, detection and management can be challenging, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Objectives Our overall objective was to explore the perceptions and experiences of women, community members, lay health workers, and skilled healthcare providers who have experience with PPH or with preventing, detecting, and managing PPH, in community or health facility settings. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and grey literature on 13 November 2022 with no language restrictions. We then performed reference checking and forward citation searching of the included studies. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed‐methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that explored perceptions and experiences of PPH prevention, detection, and management among women, community members, traditional birth attendants, healthcare providers, and managers. Data collection and analysis We used three‐stage maximum variation sampling to ensure diversity in terms of relevance of the study to the review objectives, richness of data, and coverage of critical contextual elements: setting (region, country income level), perspective (type of participant), and topic (prevention, detection, management). We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We used thematic synthesis to analyse and synthesise the evidence, and we used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. To identify factors that may influence intervention implementation, we mapped each review finding to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capability, Motivation, and Opportunity model of Behaviour change (COM‐B). We used the Behaviour Change Wheel to explore implications for practice. Main results We included 67 studies and sampled 43 studies for our analysis. Most were from low‐ or middle‐income countries (33 studies), and most included the perspectives of women and health workers. We downgraded our confidence in several findings from high confidence to moderate, low, or very‐low confidence, mainly due to concerns about how the studies were conducted (methodological limitations) or concerns about missing important perspectives from some types of participants or in some settings (relevance). In many communities, bleeding during and after childbirth is considered ""normal"" and necessary to expel ""impurities"" and restore and cleanse the woman's body after pregnancy and birth (moderate confidence). In some communities, people have misconceptions about causes of PPH or believe that PPH is caused by supernatural powers or evil spirits that punish women for ignoring or disobeying social rules or for past mistakes (high confidence). For women who give birth at home or in the community, female family members or traditional birth attendants are the first to recognise excess bleeding after birth (high confidence). Family members typically take the decision of whether and when to seek care if PPH is suspected, and these family members are often influenced by trusted traditional birth attendants or community midwives (high confidence). If PPH is identified for women birthing at home or in the community, decision‐making about the subsequent referral and care pathway can be multifaceted and complex (high confidence). First responders to PPH are not always skilled or trained healthcare providers (high confidence). In health facilities, midwives may consider it easy to implement visual estimation of blood loss with a kidney dish or under‐pad, but difficult to accurately interpret the amount of blood loss (very low confidence). Quantifying (rather than estimating) blood loss may be a complex and contentious change of practice for health workers (low confidence). Women who gave birth in health facilities and experienced PPH described it as painful, embarrassing, and traumatic. Partners or other family members also found the experience stressful. While some women were dissatisfied with their level of involvement in decision‐making for PPH management, others felt health workers were best placed to make decisions (moderate confidence). Inconsistent availability of resources (drugs, medical supplies, blood) causes delays in the timely management of PPH (high confidence). There is limited availability of misoprostol in the community owing to stockouts, poor supply systems, and the difficulty of navigating misoprostol procurement for community health workers (moderate confidence). Health workers described working on the maternity ward as stressful and intense due to short staffing, long shifts, and the unpredictability of emergencies. Exhausted and overwhelmed staff may be unable to appropriately monitor all women, particularly when multiple women are giving birth simultaneously or on the floor of the health facility; this could lead to delays in detecting PPH (moderate confidence). Inadequate staffing, high turnover of skilled health workers, and appointment of lower‐level cadres of health workers are key challenges to the provision of quality PPH care (high confidence). Through team‐based simulation training, health workers of different cadres (doctors, midwives, lay health workers) can develop a shared mental model to help them work quickly, efficiently, and amicably as a team when managing women with PPH (moderate confidence). Authors' conclusions Our findings highlight how improving PPH prevention, detection, and management is underpinned by a complex system of interacting roles and behaviours (community, women, health workers of different types and with different experiences). Multiple individual, sociocultural, and environmental factors influence the decisions and behaviours of women, families, communities, health workers, and managers. It is crucial to consider the broader health and social systems when designing and implementing PPH interventions to change or influence these behaviours. We have developed a set of prompts that may help programme managers, policymakers, researchers, and other key stakeholders to identify and address factors that affect implementation and scale‐up of interventions to improve PPH prevention, detection, and management. Plain language summary Perceptions and experiences of the prevention, detection and management of postpartum haemorrhage: a qualitative evidence synthesis What is the aim of this synthesis? Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is when women experience excessive blood loss after birth. PPH is the leading cause of maternal death. The aim of this Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence was to explore factors that influence PPH prevention, detection (identifying women with excessive blood loss), and management (treating women with PPH). To answer this question, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies that explored the views and experiences of women, community members, and health workers. Key messages Cultural beliefs around postpartum bleeding influence individual and community perspectives on PPH. When women give birth at home or in communities, cultural beliefs lead to delays in seeking care. In health facilities, health workers have difficulty estimating blood loss after birth. Common challenges in managing PPH include insufficient staffing, stressful working conditions, insufficient training, and lack of medication and supplies. What was studied in this synthesis? It is possible to prevent complications of PPH with timely detection and initiation of appropriate evidence‐based treatments. However, detection and management of PPH can be challenging, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Challenges include unequal access to hospitals and limited access to effective medicines. We sought to collect the views of women and community members on the causes and consequences of PPH, to record the experiences of women who survived PPH, and to discover how PPH is managed in home or community settings. We also sought to understand health workers' views on and experiences with PPH, including perceived barriers to PPH prevention, detection, and management. What are the main findings of this synthesis? We sampled 43 studies from 26 countries for our analysis. Most studies were from low‐ or middle‐income countries (33 studies) and included the perspectives of women and health workers. We downgraded our confidence in several findings from high confidence to moderate, low, or very‐low confidence, mainly because we had concerns about how the studies were conducted (methodological limitations) or about missing important perspectives from some types of participants or in some settings (relevance).

For a sizeable number of children, chronic non‐cancer pain has considerable negative impacts on their lives and quality of life, and leads to increased use of healthcare services and medication. In many countries, there are few services for managing children’s chronic non‐cancer pain, with many services being inadequate. Fourteen Cochrane Reviews assessing the effects of pharmacological, psychological, psychosocial, dietary or physical activity interventions for managing children’s chronic non‐cancer pain identified a lack of high‐quality evidence to inform pain management. To design and deliver services and interventions that meet the needs of patients and their families, we need to understand how children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families experience pain, their views of services and treatments for chronic pain, and which outcomes are important to them. Objectives 1. To synthesise qualitative studies that examine the experiences and perceptions of children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families regarding chronic non‐cancer pain, treatments and services to inform the design and delivery of health and social care services, interventions and future research. 2. To explore whether our review findings help to explain the results of Cochrane Reviews of intervention effects of treatments for children's chronic non‐cancer pain. 3. To determine if programme theories and outcomes of interventions match children and their families’ views of desired treatments and outcomes. 4. To use our findings to inform the selection and design of patient‐reported outcome measures for use in chronic non‐cancer pain studies and interventions and care provision to children and their families. The review questions are: 1. How do children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families conceptualise chronic pain? 2. How do children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families live with chronic pain? 3. What do children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families think of how health and social care services respond to and manage their child’s chronic pain? 4. What do children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families conceptualise as ‘good’ chronic pain management and what do they want to achieve from chronic pain management interventions and services? Search methods Review strategy: we comprehensively searched 12 bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and grey literature sources, and conducted supplementary searches in 2020. We updated the database searches in September 2022. Selection criteria To identify published and unpublished qualitative research with children aged 3 months to 18 years with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families focusing on their perceptions, experiences and views of chronic pain, services and treatments. The final inclusion criteria were agreed with a patient and public involvement group of children and young people with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families. Data collection and analysis We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis using meta‐ethnography, a seven‐phase, systematic, interpretive, inductive methodology that takes into account the contexts and meanings of the original studies. We assessed the richness of eligible studies and purposively sampled rich studies ensuring they addressed the review questions. Cochrane Qualitative Methods Implementation Group guidance guided sampling. We assessed the methodological limitations of studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. We extracted data on study aims, focus, characteristics and conceptual findings from study reports using NVivo software. We compared these study data to determine how the studies related to one another and grouped studies by pain conditions for synthesis. We used meta‐ethnography to synthesise each group of studies separately before synthesising them all together. Analysis and interpretation of studies involved children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families and has resulted in theory to inform service design and delivery. Sampling, organising studies for synthesis, and analysis and interpretation involved our patient and public involvement group who contributed throughout the conduct of the review. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each review finding. We used a matrix approach to integrate our findings with existing Cochrane Reviews on treatment effectiveness for children’s chronic non‐cancer pain. Main results We synthesised 43 studies sampled from 170 eligible studies reported in 182 publications. Included studies involved 633 participants. GRADE‐CERQual assessments of findings were mostly high (n = 21, 58%) or moderate (n = 12, 33%) confidence with three (8%) low or very low confidence. Poorly managed, moderate or severe chronic non‐cancer pain had profound adverse impacts on family dynamics and relationships; family members’ emotions, well‐being, autonomy and sense of self‐identity; parenting strategies; friendships and socialising; children’s education and future employment prospects; and parental employment. Most children and parents understood chronic non‐cancer pain as having an underlying biological cause and wanted curative treatment. However, families had difficulties seeking and obtaining support from health services to manage their child’s pain and its impacts. Children and parents felt that healthcare professionals did not always listen to their experiences and expertise, or believe the child's pain. Some families repeatedly visited health services seeking a diagnosis and cure. Over time, some children and families gave up hope of effective treatment. Outcomes measured within trials and Cochrane Reviews of intervention effects did not include some outcomes of importance to children and families, including impacts of pain on the whole family and absence of pain. Cochrane Reviews have mainly neglected a holistic biopsychosocial approach, which specifies the interrelatedness of biological, psychological and social aspects of illness, when selecting outcome measures and considering how chronic pain management interventions work. Authors' conclusions We had high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to most review findings. Further research, especially into families' experiences of treatments and services, could strengthen the evidence for low or very low confidence findings. Future research should also explore families' experiences in low‐ to middle‐income contexts; of pain treatments including opioid use in children, which remains controversial; and of social care services. We need development and testing of family‐centred interventions and services acceptable to families. Future trials of children's chronic non‐cancer pain interventions should include family‐centred outcomes. Plain language summary Children with chronic non‐cancer pain and their families’ experiences and understanding of their condition, pain services and treatments: a meta‐ethnography What is the aim of this synthesis? The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to find out how children and young people who have chronic pain and their families: 1) think about chronic pain; 2) live with chronic pain; 3) think of how health and social care services treated their pain; and 4) what they want from services and treatments. To answer these questions, we searched for, analysed and brought together the findings of all the relevant qualitative studies looking at these topics. This qualitative evidence synthesis links to 14 Cochrane Reviews assessing the effect of treatments on children with chronic pain. What was studied in this synthesis? Around 20% to 35% of children and young people worldwide have pain lasting 12 weeks or more (we call this chronic pain). It can lead to poorer health, quality of life, and stop them participating in school and social activities. Chronic pain can lead to higher use of healthcare services and treatments. If a child’s chronic pain is not successfully treated it can continue into adulthood. In many countries, there are few services for managing children’s chronic pain and current services are inadequate. United Kingdom and global clinical guidelines for managing chronic pain and 14 recent Cochrane Reviews on treatment effectiveness for children’s chronic pain identified a severe lack of high‐quality research to inform chronic pain management in children. In this qualitative evidence synthesis, we pulled together the different findings from published research studies, which asked children with chronic pain and their families about what it is like to live with chronic pain, their experiences of health care or what they want to get from treatments, to try to understand more about children’s chronic pain in order to improve health care. Young people with chronic pain and their families, pain charities, healthcare professionals such as doctors, and research experts worked with us throughout the review to help us make decisions, analyse studies and tell others our findings. The funder of this research was the National Institute for Health Research in the United Kingdom. What are the main findings of this synthesis? We identified 170 eligible studies and included 43 of the most relevant studies, 39 from high‐income countries and four from low‐ to middle‐income countries. The included studies involved a total of 633 participants. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of adolescents with chronic non‐cancer pain and their parents in the United Kingdom. Moderate or severe chronic pain negatively affected a child or young person's whole family, family life and their social lives. Children and their families wanted to know the cause of the pain and have it resolved, but they found it difficult to get help and treatments that worked from health services. Sometimes healthcare professionals did not believe the child was in pain or listen to how pain affected them. Some families made many repeated visits to health services seeking a diagnosis and cure. Often families were left to deal with chronic pain on their own, which could negatively impact the whole family. Over time, some children and families realised their pain was unlikely to be cured and so focused on living well with pain or gave up hope of effective treatment. How up‐to‐date is this synthesis?

We included studies that explored the perspectives of adults aged 18 years or older who were invited to take part in vaccine trials in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. Data collection and analysis We assessed the title, abstracts and full texts identified by the search. We used a sampling frame to identify data‐rich studies that represented a range of diseases and geographical spread. We used QSR NVivo to manage extracted data. We assessed methodological limitations using an adapted version of the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool for qualitative studies. We used the 'best‐fit framework approach' to analyse and synthesise the evidence from our included studies. We then used the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE‐CERQual) assessment to assess our confidence in each finding and develop implications for practice. Main results We included 34 studies in our review. Most studies related to HIV vaccine trials. The other studies related to Ebola virus, tuberculosis, Zika virus and COVID‐19. We developed 20 key findings, under three broad themes (with seven subthemes), that described the factors that people consider when deciding whether to take part in a vaccine trial for a pandemic or epidemic disease. Our GRADE‐CERQual confidence was high in nine of the key findings, moderate in 10 key findings and low in one key finding. The main reason for downgrading review findings were concerns regarding the relevance and adequacy of the underlying data. As a result of the over‐representation of HIV studies, our GRADE‐CERQual assessment of some findings was downgraded in terms of relevance because the views described may not reflect those of people regarding vaccine trials for other pandemic or epidemic diseases. Adequacy relates to the degree of richness and quantity of data supporting a review finding. Moderate concerns about adequacy resulted in a downgrading of some review findings. Some factors were considered to be under the control of the trial team. These included how trial information was communicated and the inclusion of people in the community to help with trial information dissemination. Aspects of trial design were also considered under control of the trial team and included convenience of participation, provision of financial incentives and access to additional support services for those taking part in the trial. Other factors influencing people's decision to take part could be personal, from family, friends or wider society. From a personal perceptive, people had concerns about vaccine side effects, vaccine efficacy and possible impact on their daily lives (carer responsibilities, work, etc.). People were also influenced by their families, and the impact participation may have on relationships. The fear of stigma from society influenced the decision to take part. Also, from a societal perspective, the level of trust in governments' involvement in research and trial may influence a person's decision. Finally, the perceived rewards, both personal and societal, were influencing factors on the decision to participate. Personal rewards included access to a vaccine, improved health and improved disease knowledge, and a return to normality in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. Potential societal rewards included helping the community and contributing to science, often motivated by the memories of family and friends who had died from the disease. Authors' conclusions This review identifies many of the factors that influence a person's decision to take part in a vaccine trial, and these reflect findings from reviews that examine trials more broadly. However, we also recognise some factors that become more important in connection with a vaccine trial in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. These factors include the potential stigma of taking part, the possible adverse effects of a vaccine, the added motivation for helping society, the role of community leaders in trial dissemination, and the level of trust placed in governments and companies developing vaccines. These specific influences need to be considered by trial teams when designing, and communicating about, vaccine trials in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. Plain language summary What factors influence a person's willingness to take part in a vaccine trial during an epidemic or pandemic? What is the aim of this review? Vaccines are important for reducing the spread of infectious diseases during a pandemic such as COVID‐19. Clinical trials test these vaccines to make sure that they are safe and effective. But it can be challenging to find enough people who are willing to take part in a vaccine trial for a pandemic or epidemic disease. The aim of this Cochrane Review of qualitative research (or 'qualitative evidence synthesis') was to find out what influences a person's decision to take part in a vaccine trial in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. Understanding the factors that influence a person's decision to participate in a vaccine trial can inform trial design and development of recruitment strategies that optimise communication, informed consent, and participant inclusion and diversity in vaccine clinical trials. To answer the review question, we analysed 34 studies of people's views and experiences of taking part in a vaccine trial. Key messages Many factors influence a person's decision to take part in a vaccine trial during a pandemic or epidemic. People are influenced by the way in which the trial is set up and how information about the trial is communicated. People are also influenced by what they think the possible risks and side effects are. Friends and family may also have influenced their decision. A fear of stigma and distrust in governments may prevent people from taking part in a vaccine trial. People may often see the chance to help others and prevent the spread of disease as a reason to take part in a vaccine trial. What did we find? We included 34 studies that looked at people's views and experiences of being invited to take part in a vaccine trial in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. Most of the studies related to HIV vaccine trials. The other studies related to Ebola virus, tuberculosis, Zika virus and COVID‐19. Studies were set in many countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. The studies looked at the views and experiences of adults aged 18 years and over who had been invited to take part in vaccine clinical trials. Some of them had accepted and some had decided not to take part. Main results We identified several factors that people consider when deciding whether to take part in a vaccine trial during a pandemic or epidemic. We judged our confidence in these findings to be low, moderate or high depending on how well supported that finding was from the included studies. We had moderate to high confidence in most of the findings. Some of the factors that influenced people's decisions were under the control of the team setting up the trial. For instance, people were influenced by how trial information was communicated, and whether community members were involved in information delivery. They were also influenced by how easy or convenient it was to take part in the trial, whether they would be paid to take part and whether they would get access to additional support or health services. Other factors included personal concerns, and the influence of family and friends and wider society. From a personal point of view, people had concerns about vaccine side effects, how well the vaccine works, and how taking part in the trial might impact on their daily lives and responsibilities. People were also influenced by their families and whether taking part might affect their relationships with others. Some people feared stigma from their communities if they took part. People's level of trust in the government's involvement in research and trials could also influence their decisions. People also considered the possible rewards of taking part in a trial and whether these outweighed the risks. Some of these rewards were personal. People wanted to get faster access to a vaccine, improve their health, improve their understanding of the disease and return to normal life during a pandemic or epidemic. But people were also motivated by wanting to help society and contribute to science. This was often tied to memories of family and friends who had died from the disease. What are the limitations of the evidence? We identified 34 studies for this review, but 26 were related to HIV. This raised concerns about the relevance of the data to other diseases. In addition, we had concerns about the quality of the data for some findings. Because of the diversity of the participants in individual studies, we cannot make any inferences by participant types (for example, participants' backgrounds, gender, or social standing or class). How up‐to‐date is this evidence? This review includes studies published before the end of June 2021.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*COVID-19; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; *Zika Virus; *Zika Virus Infection; Adult; Fear; Friends; Humans; Pandemics","10.1002/14651858.MR000065.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.MR000065.pub2","Methodology; Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"
"CD013603.PUB3","Moloi, H; Daniels, K; Brooke-Sumner, C; Cooper, S; Odendaal, WA; Thorne, M; Akama, E; Leon, N","Healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration: a scoping review of qualitative evidence","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Primary healthcare (PHC) integration has been promoted globally as a tool for health sector reform and universal health coverage (UHC), especially in low‐resource settings. However, for a range of reasons, implementation and impact remain variable. PHC integration, at its simplest, can be considered a way of delivering PHC services together that sometimes have been delivered as a series of separate or 'vertical' health programmes. Healthcare workers are known to shape the success of implementing reform interventions. Understanding healthcare worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration can therefore provide insights into the role healthcare workers play in shaping implementation efforts and the impact of PHC integration. However, the heterogeneity of the evidence base complicates our understanding of their role in shaping the implementation, delivery, and impact of PHC integration, and the role of contextual factors influencing their responses. Objectives To map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration to characterise the evidence base, with a view to better inform future syntheses on the topic. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 28 July 2020. We did not search for grey literature due to the many published records identified. Selection criteria We included studies with qualitative and mixed methods designs that reported on healthcare worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration from any country. We excluded settings other than PHC and community‐based health care, participants other than healthcare workers, and interventions broader than healthcare services. We used translation support from colleagues and Google Translate software to screen non‐English records. Where translation was not feasible we categorised these records as studies awaiting classification. Data collection and analysis For data extraction, we used a customised data extraction form containing items developed using inductive and deductive approaches. We performed independent extraction in duplicate for a sample on 10% of studies allowed for sufficient agreement to be reached between review authors. We analysed extracted data quantitatively by counting the number of studies per indicator and converting these into proportions with additional qualitative descriptive information. Indicators included descriptions of study methods, country setting, intervention type, scope and strategies, implementing healthcare workers, and client target population. Main results The review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed methods with cross‐sectional qualitative design (mainly interviews and focus group discussions), and few used longitudinal or ethnographic (or both) designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with close to an even split in the proportions of high‐income countries (HICs) and low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). There were gaps in the geographical spread for both HICs and LMICs and some countries were more dominant, such as the USA for HICs, South Africa for middle‐income countries, and Uganda for low‐income countries. Methods were mainly cross‐sectional observational studies with few longitudinal studies. A minority of studies used an analytical conceptual model to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of the integration study. The main finding was the various levels of diversity found in the evidence base on PHC integration studies that examined healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences. The review identified six different configurations of health service streams that were being integrated and these were categorised as: mental and behavioural health; HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and sexual reproductive health; maternal, women, and child health; non‐communicable diseases; and two broader categories, namely general PHC services, and allied and specialised services. Within the health streams, the review mapped the scope of the interventions as full or partial integration. The review mapped the use of three different integration strategies and categorised these as horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkage strategies. The wide range of healthcare workers who participated in the implementation of integration interventions was mapped and these included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay healthcare workers, and health system support staff. We mapped the range of client target populations. Authors' conclusions This scoping review provides a systematic, descriptive overview of the heterogeneity in qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experience of PHC integration, pointing to diversity with regard to country settings; study types; client populations; healthcare worker populations; and intervention focus, scope, and strategies. It would be important for researchers and decision‐makers to understand how the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context may influence how healthcare workers shape PHC integration impact. The classification of studies on the various dimensions (e.g. integration focus, scope, strategy, and type of healthcare workers and client populations) can help researchers to navigate the way the literature varies and for specifying potential questions for future qualitative evidence syntheses. Plain language summary Healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration: a scoping review of qualitative evidence What is primary healthcare integration? Primary healthcare integration is a way of combining different primary healthcare services that have previously been delivered separately. The aim of this integration is usually to give people better access to healthcare and to make more efficient use of limited health resources. Why is it important to know about healthcare workers' views and experiences? Primary healthcare integration has been implemented in many different countries with varying success. Healthcare workers can influence the extent to which such changes in health services are implemented successfully. Learning about healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration can help us understand how healthcare workers might influence its implementation and its success or failure. What was the purpose of this scoping review? This scoping review searched for and mapped qualitative studies (studies with no numerical data) about healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration. We wanted to describe the available research to help inform future systematic reviews and research studies in this area. How did we identify and map the evidence? We searched for all published qualitative studies that reported on healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration up to 28 July 2020. We described the different study methods, countries, the scope and type of primary healthcare integration approaches, and the different types of healthcare workers and client groups involved. We then grouped the studies into categories. What did we find? We included 184 studies. The studies were from 37 countries. About half the studies took place in high‐income countries and half in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The studies we found in our review covered a variety of settings, participants, and types of primary healthcare integration. There were different configurations for which healthcare service programmes were being combined for integrated service delivery. These were categorised into the following six configurations: mental health; HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health; maternal, woman, and child health; non‐communicable diseases (for example, heart disease, diabetes); general primary health integration, and allied and specialised services. We also explored whether integrated service delivery was fully or partially integrated, and the different integration strategies used to link and co‐ordinate services. The people participating in the implementation of integration interventions included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay health workers, and health system support staff. A wide range of clients were recipients of the integrated services. Author's conclusions This scoping review shows the variety of primary healthcare integration approaches that have been studied. Researchers and decision‐makers need to understand the relationship between different integration approaches and contexts, and the ways in which healthcare workers influence the impacts of this integration. The study categories we have developed can help researchers to understand these different types of integration approaches and to identify more focused questions for future systematic reviews.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Health Personnel; *Health Services; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family; Female; Humans; Primary Health Care","10.1002/14651858.CD013603.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013603.pub3","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

Social protection, which includes policies and programmes intended to prevent and reduce poverty in times of ill health, could be one way to break this vicious cycle. Social protection, particularly cash transfers, also has the potential to promote healthier behaviours, including healthcare seeking. Although social protection, particularly conditional and unconditional cash transfers, has been widely studied, it is not well known how recipients experience social protection interventions, and what unintended effects such interventions can cause.   Objectives The aim of this review was to explore how conditional and unconditional cash transfer social protection interventions with a health outcome are experienced and perceived by their recipients.  Search methods We searched Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Social Services Abstracts, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, AnthroSource and EconLit from the start of the database to 5 June 2020. We combined this with reference checking, citation searching, grey literature and contact with authors to identify additional studies. We reran all strategies in July 2022, and the new studies are awaiting classification. Selection criteria We included primary studies, using qualitative methods or mixed‐methods studies with qualitative research reporting on recipients’ experiences of cash transfer interventions where health outcomes were evaluated. Recipients could be adult patients of healthcare services, the general adult population as recipients of cash targeted at themselves or directed at children. Studies could be evaluated on any mental or physical health condition or cash transfer mechanism. Studies could come from any country and be in any language. Two authors independently selected studies.  Data collection and analysis We used a multistep purposive sampling framework for selecting studies, starting with geographical representation, followed by health condition, and richness of data. Key data were extracted by the authors into Excel. Methodological limitations were assessed independently using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) criteria by two authors. Data were synthesised using meta‐ethnography, and confidence in findings was assessed using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE‐CERQual) approach.  Main results We included 127 studies in the review and sampled 41 of these studies for our analysis. Thirty‐two further studies were found after the updated search on 5 July 2022 and are awaiting classification. The sampled studies were from 24 different countries: 17 studies were from the African region, seven were from the region of the Americas, seven were from the European region, six were from the South‐East Asian region, three from the Western Pacific region and one study was multiregional, covering both the African and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of cash transfer recipients with different health conditions, such as infectious diseases, disabilities and long‐term illnesses, sexual and reproductive health, and maternal and child health. Our GRADE‐CERQual assessment indicated we had mainly moderate‐ and high‐confidence findings. We found that recipients perceived the cash transfers as necessary and helpful for immediate needs and, in some cases, helpful for longer‐term benefits. However, across conditional and unconditional programmes, recipients often felt that the amount given was too little in relation to their total needs. They also felt that the cash alone was not enough to change their behaviour and, to change behaviour, additional types of support would be required. The cash transfer was reported to have important effects on empowerment, autonomy and agency, but also in some settings, recipients experienced pressure from family or programme staff on cash usage. The cash transfer was reported to improve social cohesion and reduce intrahousehold tension. However, in settings where some received the cash and others did not, the lack of an equal approach caused tension, suspicion and conflict. Recipients also reported stigma in terms of cash transfer programme assessment processes and eligibility, as well as inappropriate eligibility processes. Across settings, recipients experienced barriers in accessing the cash transfer programme, and some refused or were hesitant to receive the cash. Some recipients found cash transfer programmes more acceptable when they agreed with the programme's goals and processes.   Authors' conclusions Our findings highlight the impact of the sociocultural context on the functioning and interaction between the individual, family and cash transfer programmes. Even where the goals of a cash transfer programme are explicitly health‐related, the outcomes may be far broader than health alone and may include, for example, reduced stigma, empowerment and increased agency of the individual. When measuring programme outcomes, therefore, these broader impacts could be considered for understanding the health and well‐being benefits of cash transfers.   Plain language summary Experiences and perceptions of cash transfers for health  What is the aim of this synthesis?  The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore how people receiving health‐related conditional or unconditional cash transfers experienced them. We analysed 41 qualitative studies to answer this question. Key messages  People appreciate cash transfers and see them as necessary for their basic needs. However, cash transfers can influence people’s relationships in positive and negative ways. Not all people want to receive cash and some recipients do not perceive that cash alone will be enough to change their health behaviour.  What was studied in this synthesis?  Conditional and unconditional cash transfer programmes are found across the world. A conditional cash transfer is money (cash) that is given to people if they behave in a certain way. For example, parents could receive cash if they take their children to a health centre. An unconditional cash transfer is money that is given without any conditions or rules about its use. In some settings, people receive cash transfers through government programmes. In other settings, cash transfers are mainly given through non‐governmental organisations or research projects. Many of these programmes aim to improve people’s health, but research measuring the effect of these programmes on health shows mixed results. We, therefore, wanted to explore how people experienced these programmes.  What are the main findings?  We included 127 studies in the review and sampled 41 of these studies for our analysis. Thirty‐two further studies were found after the updated search on 5 July 2022 and are awaiting classification. The sampled studies were from 24 different countries, across all World Health Organization regions. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of cash transfer recipients with different health conditions, such as infectious diseases, disabilities and long‐term illnesses, sexual and reproductive health, and maternal and child health. We had mainly moderate‐to‐high confidence in our findings. We found that people receiving the cash transfers saw them as necessary. They described the cash as helpful in the short term, and sometimes in the long term. However, people often felt that the amount given was too little to meet their needs. They also felt that the cash alone was not enough to change their behaviour and that they also needed other types of support, such as social or psychological support or training and opportunities for employment. People described how the cash empowered them and made them more independent, especially women and people with disabilities. In some settings, people experienced pressure from family or programme staff on how to use cash. People described how the cash had improved their relationships with their families and the community. However, in communities where some received the cash and others did not, this could also cause tension, suspicion and conflict. Some people also described being stigmatised for receiving cash transfers. While people often experienced barriers to accessing cash, some refused or were hesitant to receive the cash. Some recipients found cash transfer programmes more acceptable when they agreed with programme goals and processes. How up‐to‐date is this synthesis?  We searched for studies published before 5 June 2020. The search was rerun in July 2022 and an additional 32 studies are awaiting classification.

There are many ways to partner with consumers to improve health services, including formal group partnerships (such as committees, boards or steering groups). However, consumers' and health providers' views and experiences of formal group partnerships remain unclear. In this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), we focus specifically on formal group partnerships where health providers and consumers share decision‐making about planning, delivering and/or evaluating health services. Formal group partnerships were selected because they are widely used throughout the world to improve person‐centred care. For the purposes of this QES, the term 'consumer' refers to a person who is a patient, carer or community member who brings their perspective to health service partnerships. 'Health provider' refers to a person with a health policy, management, administrative or clinical role who participates in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. This QES was co‐produced with a Stakeholder Panel of consumers and health providers. The QES was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane intervention review entitled  Effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership on health services planning, delivery and evaluation. Objectives 1. To synthesise the views and experiences of consumers and health providers of formal partnership approaches that aimed to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. 2. To identify best practice principles for formal partnership approaches in health services by understanding consumers' and health providers' views and experiences. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL for studies published between January 2000 and October 2018. We also searched grey literature sources including websites of relevant research and policy organisations involved in promoting person‐centred care. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies that explored consumers' and health providers' perceptions and experiences of partnering in formal group formats to improve the planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. Data collection and analysis Following completion of abstract and full‐text screening, we used purposive sampling to select a sample of eligible studies that covered a range of pre‐defined criteria, including rich data, range of countries and country income level, settings, participants, and types of partnership activities. A Framework Synthesis approach was used to synthesise the findings of the sample. We appraised the quality of each study using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skill Program) tool. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. The Stakeholder Panel was involved in each stage of the review from development of the protocol to development of the best practice principles. Main results We found 182 studies that were eligible for inclusion. From this group, we selected 33 studies to include in the final synthesis. These studies came from a wide range of countries including 28 from high‐income countries and five from low‐ or middle‐income countries (LMICs). Each of the studies included the experiences and views of consumers and/or health providers of partnering in formal group formats. The results were divided into the following categories. Contextual factors influencing partnerships:  government policy, policy implementation processes and funding, as well as the organisational context of the health service, could facilitate or impede partnering (moderate level of confidence). Consumer recruitment:  consumer recruitment occurred in different ways and consumers managed the recruitment process in a minority of studies only (high level of confidence). Recruiting a range of consumers who were reflective of the clinic's demographic population was considered desirable, particularly by health providers (high level of confidence). Some health providers perceived that individual consumers' experiences were not generalisable to the broader population whereas consumers perceived it could be problematic to aim to represent a broad range of community views (high level of confidence). Partnership dynamics and processes:  positive interpersonal dynamics between health providers and consumers facilitated partnerships (high level of confidence). However, formal meeting formats and lack of clarity about the consumer role could constrain consumers’ involvement (high level of confidence). Health providers’ professional status, technical knowledge and use of jargon were intimidating for some consumers (high level of confidence) and consumers could feel their experiential knowledge was not valued (moderate level of confidence). Consumers could also become frustrated when health providers dominated the meeting agenda (moderate level of confidence) and when they experienced token involvement, such as a lack of decision‐making power (high level of confidence) Perceived impacts on partnership participants:  partnering could affect health provider and consumer participants in both positive and negative ways (high level of confidence). Perceived impacts on health service planning, delivery and evaluation:  partnering was perceived to improve the person‐centredness of health service culture (high level of confidence), improve the built environment of the health service (high level of confidence), improve health service design and delivery e.g. facilitate 'out of hours' services or treatment closer to home (high level of confidence), enhance community ownership of health services, particularly in LMICs (moderate level of confidence), and improve consumer involvement in strategic decision‐making, under certain conditions (moderate level of confidence). There was limited evidence suggesting partnering may improve health service evaluation (very low level of confidence). Best practice principles for formal partnering to promote person‐centred care were developed from these findings. The principles were developed collaboratively with the Stakeholder Panel and included leadership and health service culture; diversity; equity; mutual respect; shared vision and regular communication; shared agendas and decision‐making; influence and sustainability. Authors' conclusions Successful formal group partnerships with consumers require health providers to continually reflect and address power imbalances that may constrain consumers' participation. Such imbalances may be particularly acute in recruitment procedures, meeting structure and content and decision‐making processes. Formal group partnerships were perceived to improve the physical environment of health services, the person‐centredness of health service culture and health service design and delivery. Implementing the best practice principles may help to address power imbalances, strengthen formal partnering, improve the experiences of consumers and health providers and positively affect partnership outcomes. Plain language summary What are consumers and health providers' views and experiences of working in formal partnerships to plan, deliver and evaluate health services? Key messages ‐Power imbalances between health providers and consumers can limit consumer participation in health service planning, delivery and evaluation. ‐Power imbalances in the partnership may happen because of the ways consumers are recruited, how meetings are run, and how decisions are made. ‐To have successful partnerships with consumers, health providers need to address these power imbalances.  ‐Some consumers and health providers believed that partnerships improved the culture and environment of the health service, as well as how health services were planned and developed. Why is it important that consumers and health providers work together to plan, deliver and evaluate health services? In the past, health providers decided how health services were planned, delivered and evaluated. More recently there has been a focus on designing services to better meet the needs, preferences and values of consumers. This has led to consumers partnering with health providers to design, deliver and evaluate health services. Often partnerships between consumers and health providers happen in formal group formats, such as committees, hospital boards or working groups. What did we want to find out? We wanted to explore the views and experiences of consumers and health providers working in partnership to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. We also wanted to identify best practice principles for partnering in formal group formats.   What did we do? We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) to understand the views and experiences of health providers and consumers working in partnership. A QES brings together and analyses the results from individual qualitative studies. Qualitative studies use data that are collected through interviews, focus groups, questionnaires and observations.  The QES was conducted with a Stakeholder Panel of consumers and health providers. The Panel worked with the research team to decide which questions to answer, what studies should be included, whether the analysis was comprehensive and to develop the best practice principles.  We searched databases for qualitative studies that explored consumers’ and health providers' views and experiences of partnering in formal group formats. We searched for studies published from January 2000 to October 2018. We also searched websites of organisations involved in person‐centred care, and asked experts to share relevant studies. From these searches we selected 33 studies for in‐depth analysis. The studies were from different countries and settings (e.g. hospital or community clinics) and involved different people (including under‐represented patients) and different types of formal group partnerships (e.g. committees or steering groups). We combined the results of the studies and looked for common themes. These themes became our findings. We rated our confidence in each of the findings based on the relevance, quality and quantity of the data. We grouped the findings into categories. What did we find? Our analysis identified 19 findings, which we grouped into the following five categories. Contextual factors influencing partnerships:  government policy, processes, funding, and the organisational context of the health service influenced partnering. Consumer recruitment: consumer recruitment occurred in various ways. In a few studies consumers managed the recruitment process. Some people (particularly health providers) felt consumers should reflect the range of people who used the health service. Some health providers thought that the experience of some consumers did not reflect the broader population. Consumers sometimes found it difficult to represent a broad range of community views. Partnership dynamics and processes: positive relationships between health providers and consumers improved  partnerships. Formal meetings and being unclear about the consumer role could limit consumers’ involvement. Health providers’ professional status, technical knowledge, and use of jargon could be intimidating for consumers. Consumers sometimes felt their knowledge was not valued. Consumers could become frustrated when they lacked decision‐making power, and when health providers dominated the meeting agenda. Perceived impacts on partnership participants: formal partnerships could affect health providers and consumers in both positive and negative ways. Perceived impacts on health service planning, delivery and evaluation: people perceivedformal partnerships may improve health service culture and the physical environment of the health service. They also felt partnerships may improve health service design and delivery. How can these findings be put into practice? Best practice principles for partnering in formal group formats were developed from the findings. Principles included leadership and health service culture; diversity; equity; mutual respect; shared vision and regular communication; shared agendas and decision‐making; influence and sustainability.  What are the limitations of the evidence? Most of the findings in this review are rated as ""high"" or ""moderate"" confidence, which means the evidence for the findings is strong. However, one finding that showed people perceived formal partnerships improved health service evaluation, was rated as ""very low"" confidence because it was based on weaker evidence. How up to date is this evidence? This evidence is up to date to October 2018. The review took longer than usual to complete because co‐produced research takes time, and the review was completed during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Because most of the findings are rated ""high"" or ""moderate"" confidence, we believe an updated search may not substantially change the results.

This includes the use of home‐based rehabilitation and telerehabilitation. Home‐based rehabilitation services may become frequently used options in the recovery process of patients, not only as a solution to accessibility barriers, but as a complement to the usual in‐person inpatient rehabilitation provision. Telerehabilitation is also becoming more viable as the usability and availability of communication technologies improve. Objectives To identify factors that influence the organisation and delivery of in‐person home‐based rehabilitation and home‐based telerehabilitation for people needing rehabilitation. Search methods We searched PubMed, Global Health, the VHL Regional Portal, Epistemonikos, Health Systems Evidence, and EBM Reviews as well as preprints, regional repositories, and rehabilitation organisations websites for eligible studies, from database inception to search date in June 2022.  Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; and that explored patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and other stakeholders’ experiences, perceptions and behaviours about the provision of in‐person home‐based rehabilitation and home‐based telerehabilitation services responding to patients’ needs in different phases of their health conditions.   Data collection and analysis We used a purposive sampling approach and applied maximum variation sampling in a four‐step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach.  Main results We included 223 studies in the review and sampled 53 of these for our analysis. Forty‐five studies were conducted in high‐income countries, and eight in low‐and middle‐income countries. Twenty studies addressed in‐person home‐based rehabilitation, 28 studies addressed home‐based telerehabilitation services, and five studies addressed both modes of delivery. The studies mainly explored the perspectives of healthcare providers, patients with a range of different health conditions, and their informal caregivers and family members.  Based on our GRADE‐CERQual assessments, we had high confidence in eight of the findings, and moderate confidence in five, indicating that it is highly likely or likely respectively that these findings are a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. There were two findings with low confidence. High and moderate confidence findings Home‐based rehabilitation services delivered in‐person or through telerehabilitation  Patients experience home‐based services as convenient and less disruptive of their everyday activities. Patients and providers also suggest that these services can encourage patients' self‐management and can make them feel empowered about the rehabilitation process. But patients, family members, and providers describe privacy and confidentiality issues when services are provided at home. These include the increased privacy of being able to exercise at home but also the loss of privacy when one’s home life is visible to others.  Patients and providers also describe other factors that can affect the success of home‐based rehabilitation services. These include support from providers and family members, good communication with providers, the requirements made of patients and their surroundings, and the transition from hospital to home‐based services. Telerehabilitation specifically Patients, family members and providers see telerehabilitation as an opportunity to make services more available. But providers point to practical problems when assessing whether patients are performing their exercises correctly. Providers and patients also describe interruptions from family members.  In addition, providers complain of a lack of equipment, infrastructure and maintenance and patients refer to usability issues and frustration with digital technology. Providers have different opinions about whether telerehabilitation is cost‐efficient for them. But many patients see telerehabilitation as affordable and cost‐saving if the equipment and infrastructure have been provided. Patients and providers suggest that telerehabilitation can change the nature of their relationship. For instance, some patients describe how telerehabilitation leads to easier and more relaxed communication. Other patients describe feeling abandoned when receiving telerehabilitation services.  Patients, family members and providers call for easy‐to‐use technologies and more training and support. They also suggest that at least some in‐person sessions with the provider are necessary. They feel that telerehabilitation services alone can make it difficult to make meaningful connections. They also explain that some services need the provider’s hands. Providers highlight the importance of personalising the services to each person’s needs and circumstances. Authors' conclusions This synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of in‐person home‐based rehabilitation and telerehabilitation services. These included factors that facilitate implementation, but also factors that can challenge this process. Healthcare providers, program planners and policymakers might benefit from considering these factors when designing and implementing programmes.  Plain language summary Factors that influence the provision of home‐ based rehabilitation services for people needing rehabilitation: a qualitative evidence synthesis  The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore factors that influence rehabilitation services that are delivered in people’s own homes. The synthesis looked at services that were delivered in person as well as services that were delivered through telerehabilitation. To answer this question, we analysed 53 qualitative studies. Key messages Home‐based rehabilitation, delivered in‐person or through telerehabilitation, can be experienced as more accessible and more convenient than facility‐based services. Patients, providers and family members also describe how home‐based services can change the nature of their relationships and can have practical and resource implications that can be both positive and negative. What was studied in this synthesis? The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to a stronger focus on home‐based healthcare. This includes the delivery of home‐based rehabilitation services delivered in person or using telerehabilitation. Home‐based rehabilitation services may become a common option in the recovery process of patients, either instead of facility‐based services or as a complement to these services. Telerehabilitation is also becoming more common as people’s access to digital technologies increases.  What are the main findings of this synthesis? We analysed 53 qualitative studies where patients received rehabilitation services in their own homes. In some of the studies, healthcare providers delivered the services in person. In the other studies, providers delivered the services through telerehabilitation using digital technologies. The studies explored the views and experiences of patients, families and healthcare providers. Most of the studies were from high‐income countries.  Our findings highlight several factors that can influence the organisation and delivery of home‐based rehabilitation. We have moderate to high confidence in the following findings. Home‐based rehabilitation services delivered in‐person or through telerehabilitation  Patients experience home‐based services as convenient and less disruptive of their everyday activities. Patients and providers also suggest that these services can encourage patients' self‐management and can make them feel empowered about the rehabilitation process.

Understanding the experiences and perspectives of survivors receiving such interventions, along with those of their family members, and the professionals who deliver them is important for informing decision making as to what to offer survivors, for developing new interventions, and enhancing their acceptability. Objectives This review sought to: 1. identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring the experiences of child and adult survivors of sexual abuse and violence, and their caregivers, regarding psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting survivors and preventing negative health outcomes in terms of benefits, risks/harms and barriers; 2. identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring the experiences of professionals who deliver psychosocial interventions for sexual abuse and violence in terms of perceived benefits, risks/harms and barriers for survivors and their families/caregivers; 3. develop a conceptual understanding of how different factors influence uptake, dropout or completion, and outcomes from psychosocial interventions for sexual abuse and violence; 4. develop a conceptual understanding of how features and types of interventions responded to the needs of different user/survivor groups (e.g. age groups; types of abuse exposure; migrant populations) and contexts (healthcare/therapeutic settings; low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs)); 5. explore how the findings of this review can enhance our understanding of the findings from the linked and related reviews assessing the effectiveness of interventions aimed at supporting survivors and preventing negative health outcomes. Search methods In August 2021 we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and nine other databases. We also searched for unpublished reports and qualitative reports of quantitative studies in a linked systematic review, together with reference checking, citation searches and contacting authors and other researchers to identify relevant studies. Selection criteria We included qualitative and mixed‐methods studies (with an identifiable qualitative component) that were linked to a psychosocial intervention aimed at supporting survivors of sexual abuse and violence. Eligible studies focused on at least one of three participant groups: survivors of any age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity or [dis]ability who had received a psychosocial intervention; their carers, family members or partners; and professionals delivering such interventions. We placed no restrictions in respect of settings, locations, intervention delivery formats or durations. Data collection and analysis Six review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified. We extracted data using a form designed for this synthesis, then used this information and an appraisal of data richness and quality in order to stratify the studies using a maximum variation approach. We assessed the methodological limitations using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We coded directly onto the sampled papers using NVivo and synthesised data using a thematic synthesis methodology and used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We used a narrative synthesis and matrix model to integrate our qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) findings with those of intervention review findings. Main results We identified 97 eligible studies and sampled 37 of them for our analysis. Most sampled studies were from high‐income countries, with four from middle‐income and two from low‐income countries. In 27 sampled studies, the participants were survivors, in three they were intervention facilitators. Two included all three of our stakeholder groups, and five included two of our groups. The studies explored a wide range of psychosocial interventions, with only one type of intervention explored in more than one study. The review indicates that features associated with the context in which interventions were delivered had an impact on how individuals accessed and experienced interventions. This included organisational features, such as staff turnover, that could influence survivors' engagement with interventions; the setting or location in which interventions were delivered; and the characteristics associated with who delivered the interventions. Studies that assess the effectiveness of interventions typically assess their impact on mental health; however, as well as finding benefits to mental health, our QES found that study participants felt interventions also had positive impacts on their physical health, mood, understanding of trauma, interpersonal relationships and enabled them to re‐engage with a wide range of areas in their lives. Participants explained that features of interventions and their contexts that best enabled them to benefit from interventions were also often things that could be a barrier to benefiting from interventions. For example, the relationship with the therapist, when open and warm was a benefit, but if such a relationship could not be achieved, it was a barrier. Survivors' levels of readiness and preparedness to both start and end interventions could have positive (if they were ready) or negative (if they were not) impacts. Study participants identified the potential risks and harms associated with completing interventions but felt that it was important to face and process trauma. Some elements of interventions were specific to the intervention type (e.g. faith‐based interventions), or related to an experience of an intervention that held particular relevance to subgroups of survivors (e.g. minority groups); these issues could impact how individuals experienced delivering or receiving interventions. Authors' conclusions We had high or moderate confidence in all but one of our review findings. Further research in low‐ and middle‐income settings, with male survivors of sexual abuse and violence and those from minority groups could strengthen the evidence for low and moderate confidence findings. We found that few interventions had published quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Since this QES has highlighted important aspects that could enable interventions to be more suitable for survivors, using a range of methodologies would provide valuable information that could enhance intervention uptake, completion and effectiveness. This study has shown that although survivors often found interventions difficult, they also appreciated that they needed to work through trauma, which they said resulted in a wide range of benefits. Therefore, listening to survivors and providing appropriate interventions, at the right time for them, can make a significant difference to their health and well‐being. Plain language summary Survivor, family and professional experiences of interventions for sexual abuse and violence What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to explore the experiences of survivors of sexual abuse and violence who received interventions to support them and improve their health and well‐being, as well as experiences of their family members and the professionals who delivered such interventions. To do this, we analysed 37 studies that described views and experiences of an intervention. Key messages ‐ Survivors, their family members and professionals highlighted that the organisational settings (e.g. their locations and the approach of all staff in the organisation) within which interventions were delivered were very important for their experience of the interventions and the benefits they drew from them. ‐ Participants talked about positive outcomes from therapies and interventions, such as improved physical and mental health, mood, interpersonal relationships, understanding of trauma, and their abilities to re‐engage in a wide range of areas of their lives. ‐ Participants explained that features of interventions and their settings that best enabled them to benefit from interventions were often features that could be a barrier. For example, the relationship with the therapist when open and warm was a benefit, but if such a relationship could not be achieved, it was a barrier. ‐ Aspects of interventions relevant to subgroups of survivors (e.g. for faith‐based interventions) and the extent to which they made all survivors (e.g. survivors who were men, had a disability or were from other minority communities) feel a sense of inclusion were also important to enable each survivor to gain the most benefit from them. What was studied in this review? We looked for studies that explored the experiences of survivors and professionals who took part in interventions that supported survivors of sexual abuse and violence, or family members who supported survivors who completed these interventions. We included studies that: ‐ treated survivors who were sexually abused when they were children or adults, or both; ‐ involved participants of any age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, or [dis]ability. We included studies from any country and setting. What are the main findings of this review? We analysed 37 of the 97 studies that were relevant to our review. Most of the 37 studies were from high‐income countries and included survivors. There was a wide range of interventions that supported and responded to those who had experienced sexual abuse and violence included in these studies, with only one type of intervention examined in more than one study. Our review highlighted that people did not discuss the features of the different types of interventions (e.g. aspects related to mindfulness therapy, or rape counselling) but rather, referred to a wide range of features associated with the interventions they considered important. For example, ‐ they emphasised that a good relationship with the therapist was vital, ‐ that other members of the group (where interventions were delivered in groups) could make them feel more or less included. They also stressed that features of the wider setting of the intervention, such as the location and friendliness of a receptionist and other staff, had an important impact on them being able to benefit from interventions. The review showed that survivors benefitted from the interventions in a wide range of ways, most of which have not been examined in more quantitative research studies that look at how effective these interventions are. Such studies tend to examine mental health, but our review found that survivors thought interventions had also benefitted their: ‐ physical health, ‐ mood, ‐ relationships with others, ‐ confidence ‐ and ability to set boundaries and be assertive.

Yet, diagnostic technologies only have an impact if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Views of the intended beneficiaries are important in uptake of diagnostics, and their effective use also depends on those implementing testing programmes, including providers, laboratory professionals, and staff in health ministries. Otherwise, there is a risk these technologies will not fit their intended use and setting, cannot be made to work and scale up, and are not used by, or not accessible to, those in need. Objectives To synthesize end‐user and professional user perspectives and experiences with low‐complexity nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detection of tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance; and to identify implications for effective implementation and health equity. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Science Citation Index Expanded databases for eligible studies from 1 January 2007 up to 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular test in this review, was completed in 2009. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis, and were focused on perspectives and experiences of users and potential users of low‐complexity NAATs to diagnose tuberculosis and drug‐resistant tuberculosis. NAATs included Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, Xpert MTB/XDR, and the Truenat assays. Users were people with presumptive or confirmed tuberculosis and drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant (MDR‐TB)) and their caregivers, healthcare providers, laboratory technicians and managers, and programme officers and staff; and were from any type of health facility and setting globally. MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis. Data collection and analysis We used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed confidence in the findings using GRADE CERQual approach. We developed a conceptual framework to illustrate how the findings relate. Main results We found 32 studies. All studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Twenty‐seven studies were conducted in high‐tuberculosis burden countries and 21 studies in high‐MDR‐TB burden countries. Only one study was from an Eastern European country. While the studies covered a diverse use of low‐complexity NAATs, in only a minority of studies was it used as the initial diagnostic test for all people with presumptive tuberculosis. We identified 18 review findings and grouped them into three overarching categories. Critical aspects users value People with tuberculosis valued reaching diagnostic closure with an accurate diagnosis, avoiding diagnostic delays, and keeping diagnostic‐associated cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers valued aspects of accuracy and the resulting confidence in low‐complexity NAAT results, rapid turnaround times, and keeping cost to people seeking a diagnosis low. In addition, providers valued diversity of sample types (for example, gastric aspirate specimens and stool in children) and drug resistance information. Laboratory professionals appreciated the improved ease of use, ergonomics, and biosafety of low‐complexity NAATs compared to sputum microscopy, and increased staff satisfaction. Challenges reported to realizing those values People with tuberculosis and healthcare workers were reluctant to test for tuberculosis (including MDR‐TB) due to fears, stigma, or cost concerns. Thus, low‐complexity NAAT testing is not implemented with sufficient support or discretion to overcome barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Delays were reported at many steps of the diagnostic pathway owing to poor sample quality; difficulties with transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources; maintenance of low‐complexity NAATs; increased workload; inefficient work and patient flows; over‐reliance on low‐complexity NAAT results in lieu of clinical judgement; and lack of data‐driven and inclusive implementation processes. These challenges were reported to lead to underutilization.  Concerns for access and equity The reported concerns included sustainable funding and maintenance and equitable use of resources to access low‐complexity NAATs, as well as conflicts of interest between donors and people implementing the tests. Also, lengthy diagnostic delays, underutilization of low‐complexity NAATs, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in the community, and too many eligibility restrictions hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable groups, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or people with limited ability to pay. We had high confidence in most of our findings. Authors' conclusions Low‐complexity diagnostics have been presented as a solution to overcome deficiencies in laboratory infrastructure and lack of skilled professionals. This review indicates this is misleading. The lack of infrastructure and human resources undermine the added value new diagnostics of low complexity have for recipients and providers. We had high confidence in the evidence contributing to these review findings. Implementation of new diagnostic technologies, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, and insufficient data on ground level realities prior and during implementation, as well as problems of conflicts of interest in order to ensure equitable use of resources. Plain language summary Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers What is the aim of this review? We aimed to understand the experiences and opinions of people using rapid automated tests that identify tuberculosis and resistance to tuberculosis drugs (molecular diagnostic tests). Users include people who might have tuberculosis and their families or caregivers, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, and managers of services or programmes. What was studied in this review?   Rapid molecular diagnostic tests were designed to make diagnosis easier and faster for people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, because they do not require a well‐equipped laboratory, but can be done in clinics closer to where people live. Since these tests can also suggest whether an individual suffers from drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB)), the right treatment can be started earlier. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 32 studies conducted in areas where tuberculosis is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries. MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.  This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that examines the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid molecular test for tuberculosis drug resistance. Yet, diagnostic tests only have an impact on health if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Accuracy studies do not reveal what users think of or how they experience the test in question. We need to understand the perspectives and experiences of all users. Otherwise, we risk these tests not fitting settings where they are to be used or not being accessible for those in need. What are the main findings? People with tuberculosis value knowing what is wrong with them. People valued having an accurate diagnosis, avoiding delays in being diagnosed, having accessible testing facilities, and keeping cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers value having accurate tests that give them confidence in the diagnosis, rapid results, and keeping cost low, being able to use different specimens (such as sputum and stool)  and receiving information about drug resistance as part of the test results. Laboratory personnel appreciated that laboratory work was made easier and that staff was more satisfied thanks to rapid molecular diagnostic tests. Our review also identified several challenges to realizing these values. Some people with tuberculosis and some healthcare providers were reluctant to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests because of fears of testing positive, concerns of stigma or discredit in the community, or expenses related to the testing. Additional support is required to overcome these barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. Lastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. Overall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. How up to date is this review? We included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Tuberculosis [diagnosis, drug therapy]; *Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant [diagnosis, drug therapy]; Child; Drug Resistance; Humans; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Rifampin [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD014877.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014877.pub2","Infectious Diseases"

MDA is currently WHO policy for areas endemic with lymphatic filariasis, which is a parasitic disease that can result in swollen limbs and disability. The success depends on communities adhering to the drugs given, and this will be influenced by the perception of the drug, the programme, and those delivering it.  Objectives To synthesize qualitative research evidence about community experience with, and understanding and perception of, MDA programmes for lymphatic filariasis. To explore whether programme design and delivery influence the community experience identified in the analysis. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases up to 8 April 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria This review synthesized qualitative research and mixed‐methods studies when it was possible to extract qualitative data. Eligible studies explored community experiences, perceptions, or attitudes towards MDA programmes for lymphatic filariasis in any country, conducted between 2000 and 2019.  Data collection and analysis We extracted data on study design including: authors, aims, participants, methods, and qualitative data collection methods. We also described programme delivery factors including: country, urban or rural setting, endemicity, drug regimen, rounds of MDA received at the time of the study, who delivered the drugs, how the drugs were delivered, use of health education, and sensitization and adherence monitoring. We conducted a thematic analysis and developed codes inductively using ATLAS.ti software. We examined codes for underlying ideas, connections, and interpretations and, from this, generated analytical themes. We assessed the confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual approach, and produced a conceptual model to display our findings.  Main results From 902 results identified in the search, 29 studies met our inclusion criteria. The studies covered a broad range of countries in Africa, South‐East Asia, and South America, and explored the views and experiences of community members and community drug distributors in low‐income countries endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Four themes emerged. People weigh up benefits and harms before participating . People understand the potential benefits in terms of relief of suffering, stigma, and avoiding costs (high confidence); however, these theoretical benefits do not always mesh with their experiences (high confidence). In particular, adverse effects are frightening and unwelcome (high confidence); and these effects are amplified through rumour and social media (moderate confidence). Many people are suspicious of MDA programmes.  When people lack a scientific explanation for the programme and their experiences of it, they often develop social explanations instead. These are largely shaped on the historical backdrop and level of trust people have in relevant authority figures (high confidence), although some have unwavering faith in their government and, by extension, the programme (moderate confidence). Programmes expect compliance, and this can become coercive and blaming.  Health workers and community members stigmatize non‐compliance, which can become coercive (moderate confidence), so communities may appear to comply publicly, but privately reject treatment (moderate confidence). Community distributors are often not respected or valued.  They have little authority (moderate confidence), and the behaviour of some distributors damages the MDA programme's reputation (high confidence). Communities want information about programmes to help make decisions about participation, but drug distributors are not sufficiently informed, or skilled in this communication (high confidence). We intended to assess whether programme designs influenced communities' perceptions of the programme and decision to adhere but were unable to do so as few studies adequately reported the design and implementation of the local programme. We have moderate to high confidence in the evidence contributing to the review themes and subthemes. Authors' conclusions Adherence with MDA for filariasis is influenced by individual direct experience of benefit and harm; social influences in the community; political influences and their relationship to government; and historical influences. Fear of adverse effects was frequently described and this appears to be particularly important for communities. When views were negative, we were surprised by the strength of feeling expressed. Enthusiasm for these schemes as a strategy in global policy needs debate in the light of these findings. Plain language summary Community views on mass drug administration for filariasis: a qualitative evidence synthesis What was studied in this synthesis? Mass drug administration (MDA) involves the regular delivery of treatment medicines to whole populations, regardless of whether an individual has the disease or not, and aims to prevent onward transmission (passing from one person to another). It is currently recommended for some disease control programmes in low‐ and middle‐income countries, including the parasitic disease lymphatic filariasis, which can result in swollen limbs and disability. For governments and their health service this is a large logistical task requiring money and staff, and success depends on communities taking the medicines given.  In this review, we looked for studies that explored how people view and experience these programmes. We collected all relevant studies and included 29 in this synthesis. What was the aim of this synthesis? In this synthesis of qualitative research, we aimed to explore people's views on MDA programmes for treating lymphatic filariasis in low‐ and middle‐income countries.  Key messages  People must weigh up a number of factors before deciding to take the medicines. Not everyone benefits from MDA and some may experience harms. The decision to adhere therefore, depends on a complex balance between their trust in the government distributing the medicines; their prior understanding of the disease and the knowledge they receive on the programme; their experience of harms; the influence of family, neighbours, and health staff; and their experience and perception of the people distributing the medicines.  What were the main findings? We included 29 studies in our analysis. The studies covered a broad range of countries in Africa, South‐East Asia, and South America, although most were conducted in India. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of community members and those distributing the medicines in low‐income countries where lymphatic filariasis is considered a problem. From the data, four themes emerged. People weigh up benefits and harms before participating . People understand they can reduce the suffering, stigma and costs of developing the disease (high confidence); however, these benefits do not always mesh with their experiences (high confidence). In particular, side effects are frightening and unwelcome (high confidence); and these effects are amplified through rumour and social media (moderate confidence). Many people are suspicious of MDA programmes . When people lack a detailed explanation for the programme and their experiences of it, they often develop explanations based on the historical backdrop and level of trust people have in relevant authority figures (high confidence), although some have unwavering faith in their government and by extension the programme (moderate confidence). Programmes expect compliance, and this can become coercive and blaming . Health workers and community members stigmatize non‐compliance, which can become coercive (moderate confidence), so communities may appear to comply publicly, but privately reject treatment (moderate confidence). Community distributors are often not respected or valued . They have little authority (moderate confidence), and the behaviour of some damages the MDA programme's reputation (high confidence). Communities want information about programmes to help make decisions about participation, but drug distributors are not sufficiently informed, or skilled in this communication (high confidence). We were unable to assess the impact of programme design on communities' perception of the programme and decision to adhere as these aspects were too similar across all studies.

However, worldwide, many children do not receive all recommended vaccinations, for several potential reasons. Vaccines might be unavailable, or parents may experience difficulties in accessing vaccination services; for instance, because of poor quality health services, distance from a health facility, or lack of money. Some parents may not accept available vaccines and vaccination services. Our understanding of what influences parents’ views and practices around childhood vaccination, and why some parents may not accept vaccines for their children, is still limited. This synthesis links to Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness of interventions to improve coverage or uptake of childhood vaccination. Objectives  ‐ Explore parents’ and informal caregivers’ views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, and the factors influencing acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance of routine childhood vaccination. ‐ Develop a conceptual understanding of what and how different factors reduce parental acceptance of routine childhood vaccination. ‐ Explore how the findings of this review can enhance our understanding of the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and three other databases for eligible studies from 1974 to June 2020. Selection criteria We included studies that: utilised qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on parents’ or caregivers’ views, practices, acceptance, hesitancy, or refusal of routine vaccination for children aged up to six years; and were from any setting globally where childhood vaccination is provided. Data collection and analysis We used a pre‐specified sampling frame to sample from eligible studies, aiming to capture studies that were conceptually rich, relevant to the review's phenomenon of interest, from diverse geographical settings, and from a range of income‐level settings. We extracted contextual and methodological data from each sampled study. We used a meta‐ethnographic approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of criteria used in previous Cochrane Reviews and originally based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme quality assessment tool for qualitative studies. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We integrated the findings of this review with those from relevant Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. We did this by mapping whether the underlying theories or components of trial interventions included in those reviews related to or targeted the overarching factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination identified by this review. Main results We included 145 studies in the review and sampled 27 of these for our analysis. Six studies were conducted in Africa, seven in the Americas, four in South‐East Asia, nine in Europe, and one in the Western Pacific. Studies included urban and rural settings, and high‐, middle‐, and low‐income settings. Many complex factors were found to influence parents’ vaccination views and practices, which we divided into four themes. Firstly, parents’ vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their broader ideas and practices surrounding health and illness generally, and specifically with regards to their children, and their perceptions of the role of vaccination within this context. Secondly, many parents’ vaccination ideas and practices were influenced by the vaccination ideas and practices of the people they mix with socially. At the same time, shared vaccination ideas and practices helped some parents establish social relationships, which in turn strengthened their views and practices around vaccination. Thirdly, parents' vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by wider political issues and concerns, and particularly their trust (or distrust) in those associated with vaccination programmes. Finally, parents' vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their access to and experiences of vaccination services and their frontline healthcare workers. We developed two concepts for understanding possible pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. The first concept, ‘neoliberal logic’, suggests that many parents, particularly from high‐income countries, understood health and healthcare decisions as matters of individual risk, choice, and responsibility. Some parents experienced this understanding as in conflict with vaccination programmes, which emphasise generalised risk and population health. This perceived conflict led some parents to be less accepting of vaccination for their children. The second concept, ‘social exclusion’, suggests that some parents, particularly from low‐ and middle‐income countries, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may damage trustful relationships between government and the public, generate feelings of isolation and resentment, and give rise to demotivation in the face of public services that are poor quality and difficult to access. These factors in turn led some parents who were socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a way to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, costs, and distress it creates. Many of the overarching factors our review identified as influencing parents' vaccination views and practices were underrepresented in the interventions tested in the four related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. Authors' conclusions Our review has revealed that parents’ views and practices regarding childhood vaccination are complex and dynamic social processes that reflect multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. We have provided a theorised understanding of the social processes contributing to vaccination acceptance (or not), thereby complementing but also extending more individualistic models of vaccination acceptance. Successful development of interventions to promote acceptance and uptake of childhood vaccination will require an understanding of, and then tailoring to, the specific factors influencing vaccination views and practices of the group(s) in the target setting. The themes and concepts developed through our review could serve as a basis for gaining this understanding, and subsequent development of interventions that are potentially more aligned with the norms, expectations, and concerns of target users. Plain language summary What factors influence parents’ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines? Review aim This Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence aimed to explore the factors that influence parents’ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines. To do this, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies of parents’ views, experiences, and practices. This synthesis complements other Cochrane Reviews assessing the effect of strategies to improve the uptake of childhood vaccination. Key messages Many factors influence parents’ vaccination views and practices, including those related to individual perceptions, social relationships, and the wider context in which parents live. When parents make decisions about vaccination for their children, they are often communicating not just what they think about vaccines, but also who they are, what they value, and with whom they identify. What was studied in this synthesis? Childhood vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent serious illnesses and deaths in children. However, worldwide, many children do not receive all recommended vaccinations. There are several potential reasons for this. Vaccines might be unavailable, or parents may experience difficulties in accessing vaccination services. Some parents may not accept available vaccines and vaccination services. Our understanding of what influences parents’ views and practices around childhood vaccination, and why some parents may not accept vaccines for their children is still limited. Qualitative research explores how people perceive and experience the world around them, and is therefore well‐placed for examining these issues. What are the main findings of the review? We included 27 studies in our analysis. Studies were conducted in Africa, the Americas, South‐East Asia, Europe, and the Western Pacific, and included urban and rural settings, as well as high‐, middle‐, and low‐income settings.

Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases, including against seasonal influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster and COVID‐19. However, the uptake of vaccination among older adults varies across settings and groups. Communication with healthcare workers can play an important role in older people's decisions to vaccinate. To support an informed decision about vaccination, healthcare workers should be able to identify the older person's knowledge gaps, needs and concerns. They should also be able to share and discuss information about the person's disease risk and disease severity; the vaccine's effectiveness and safety; and practical information about how the person can access vaccines. Therefore, healthcare workers need good communication skills and to actively keep up‐to‐date with the latest evidence. An understanding of their perceptions and experiences of this communication can help us train and support healthcare workers and design good communication strategies. Objectives To explore healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus on 21 March 2020. We also searched Epistemonikos for related reviews, searched grey literature sources, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. We searched for studies in any language. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed‐methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that explored the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers and other health system staff towards communication with adults over the age of 50 years or their informal caregivers about vaccination. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined criteria. We extracted and assessed data regarding study authors' motivations for carrying out their study. We used a thematic synthesis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and we developed implications for practice. Main results We included 11 studies in our review. Most studies explored healthcare workers' views and experiences about vaccination of older adults more broadly but also mentioned communication issues specifically. All studies were from high‐income countries. The studies focused on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others working in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and nursing homes. These healthcare workers discussed different types of vaccines, including influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines. The review was carried out before COVID‐19 vaccines were available . We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate, low or very low confidence. One reason for this was that some findings were based on only small amounts of data. Another reason was that the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, making us unsure about the relevance of these findings to other settings. Healthcare workers reported that older adults asked about vaccination to different extents, ranging from not asking about vaccines at all, to great demand for information (high confidence finding). When the topic of vaccination was discussed, healthcare workers described a lack of information, and presence of misinformation, fears and concerns about vaccines among older adults (moderate confidence). The ways in which healthcare workers discussed vaccines with older adults appeared to be linked to what they saw as the aim of vaccination communication. Healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions of this aim and about their own roles and the roles of older adults in vaccine decisions. Some healthcare workers thought it was important to provide information but emphasised the right and responsibility of older adults to decide for themselves. Others used information to persuade and convince older adults to vaccinate in order to increase 'compliance' and 'improve' vaccination rates, and in some cases to gain financial benefits. Other healthcare workers tailored their approach to what they believed the older adult needed or wanted (moderate confidence). Healthcare workers believed that older adults' decisions could be influenced by several factors, including the nature of the healthcare worker–patient relationship, the healthcare worker's status, and the extent to which healthcare workers led by example (low confidence). Our review also identified factors that are likely to influence how communication between healthcare workers and older adults take place. These included issues tied to healthcare workers' views and experiences regarding the diseases in question and the vaccines; as well as their views and experiences of the organisational and practical implementation of vaccine services. Authors' conclusions There is little research focusing specifically on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communication with older adults about vaccination. The studies we identified suggest that healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions about the aim of this communication and about the role of older adults in vaccine decisions. Based on these findings and the other findings in our review, we have developed a set of questions or prompts that may help health system planners or programme managers when planning or implementing strategies for vaccination communication between healthcare workers and older adults. Plain language summary Healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination The aim of this systematic review was to explore healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination. We searched for and analysed relevant qualitative studies and included 11 studies. Key messages We found few studies that explored healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination. The studies we found suggested that healthcare workers differed among themselves in what they saw as the aim of vaccine communication and the role of older adults in vaccine decisions. Based on our findings, we developed a set of questions to help planners and programme managers when planning or implementing vaccination communication strategies between healthcare workers and older adults. What did the review study? Vaccines are available to prevent infectious diseases in older adults, including vaccines against seasonal influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster (shingles) and COVID‐19. But older adults do not always use the vaccines available to them. Communication with healthcare workers can play an important role in older people's decisions to vaccinate.

Additional advantages of CCT include the potential for reduced variability in treatment and care through clinical decision support enabled by the analysis of large data sets and the use of predictive tools. Evidence points to health systems investing in telemedicine appearing better prepared to respond to sudden increases in demand, such as during pandemics. However, challenges with how new technologies such as CCT are implemented still remain, and must be carefully considered. Objectives This synthesis links to and complements another Cochrane Review assessing the effects of interactive telemedicine in healthcare, by examining the implementation of telemedicine specifically in critical care. Our aim was to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative research evidence on healthcare stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors affecting the implementation of CCT, and to identify factors that are more likely to ensure successful implementation of CCT for subsequent consideration and assessment in telemedicine effectiveness reviews. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science for eligible studies from inception to 14 October 2019; alongside 'grey' and other literature searches. There were no language, date or geographic restrictions. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis. Studies included views from healthcare stakeholders including bedside and CCT hub critical care personnel, as well as administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff, and family members. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a predetermined extraction sheet. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) qualitative checklist to assess the methodological rigour of individual studies. We followed the Best‐fit framework approach using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform our data synthesis.  We classified additional themes not captured by CFIR under a separate theme. We used the GRADE CERQual approach to assess confidence in the findings. Main results We found 13 relevant studies. Twelve were from the USA and one was from Canada. Where we judged the North American focus of the studies to be a concern for a finding’s relevance, we have reflected this in our assessment of confidence in the finding. The studies explored the views and experiences of bedside and hub critical care personnel; administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff; and family members. The intensive care units (ICUs) were from tertiary hospitals in urban and rural areas. We identified several factors that could influence the implementation of CCT. We had high confidence in the following findings: Hospital staff and family members described several advantages of CCT.  Bedside and hub staff strongly believed that the main advantage of CCT was having access to experts when bedside physicians were not available. Families also valued having access to critical care experts. In addition, hospital staff described how CCT could support clinical decision‐making and mentoring of junior staff.  Hospital staff greatly valued the nature and quality of social networks between the bedside and CCT hub teams . Key issues for them were trust, acceptance, teamness, familiarity and effective communication between the two teams. Interactions between some bedside and CCT hub staff were featured with tension, frustration and conflict.  Staff on both sides commonly described disrespect of their expertise, resistance and animosity. Hospital staff thought it was important to promote and offer training in the use of CCT before its implementation.  This included rehearsing every step in the process, offering staff opportunities to ask questions and disseminating learning resources. Some also complained that experienced staff were taken away from bedside care and re‐allocated to the CCT hub team. Hospital staff's attitudes towards, knowledge about and value placed on CCT influenced acceptance of CCT.  Staff were positive towards CCT because of its several advantages. But some were concerned that the CCT hub staff were not able to understand the patient’s situation through the camera. Some were also concerned about confidentiality of patient data. We also identified other factors that could influence the implementation of CCT, although our confidence in these findings is moderate or low. These factors included the extent to which telemedicine software was adaptable to local needs, and hub staff were aware of local norms; concerns about additional administrative work and cost; patients' and families’ desire to stay close to their local community; the type of hospital setting; the extent to which there was support from senior leadership; staff access to information about policies and procedures; individuals' stage of change; staff motivation, competence and values; clear strategies for staff engagement; feedback about progress; and the impact of CCT on staffing levels. Authors' conclusions Our review identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of telemedicine in critical care. These include the value that hospital staff and family members place on having access to critical care experts, staff access to sufficient training, and the extent to which healthcare providers at the bedside and the critical care experts supporting them from a distance acknowledge and respect each other’s expertise. Further research, especially in contexts other than North America, with different cultures, norms and practices will strengthen the evidence base for the implementation of CCT internationally and our confidence in these findings. Implementation of CCT appears to be growing in importance in the context of global pandemic management, especially in countries with wide geographical dispersion and limited access to critical care expertise. For successful implementation, policymakers and other stakeholders should consider pre‐empting and addressing factors that may affect implementation, including strengthening teamness between bedside and hub teams; engaging and supporting frontline staff; training ICU clinicians on the use of CCT prior to its implementation; and ensuring staff have access to information and knowledge about when, why and how to use CCT for maximum benefit. Plain language summary What are healthcare stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors affecting the implementation of critical care telemedicine? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to identify factors that affect the acceptance and use of health care from a distance (known as telemedicine) for patients in intensive care units (also known as critical care). To answer this question, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies about the perceptions and experiences of clinical staff, managers and administrators, as well as patients and family members. This review links to another Cochrane Review assessing the effects of telemedicine.  Key messages Our review identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of telemedicine in critical care. These included the value that hospital staff and family members place on having access to critical care experts, staff access to sufficient training, and the extent to which healthcare providers at the bedside and the critical care experts supporting them from a distance acknowledge and respect each other’s expertise. What was studied in this synthesis? In critical care telemedicine (CCT), patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored by critical care experts based at a ‘hub’ outside the hospital. By monitoring patients, hub staff are able to warn staff at the bedside of potential problems and offer them decision support. The use of CCT means that patients and staff in rural or small hospitals have access to critical care experts. But there may still be challenges when implementing CCT. In this review, we assessed studies that looked at the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers, family members and others to find factors that could influence the acceptance and use of CCT. What are the main findings of the synthesis? We included 13 relevant studies. Twelve were from the USA and one was from Canada. Where we judged the North American focus of the studies to be a concern for a finding’s relevance, we have reflected this in our assessment of confidence in the finding. The studies explored the views and experiences of bedside and hub critical care personnel; administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff, and family members. The ICUs were from hospitals in both urban and rural areas. We identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of CCT. We had high confidence in the following findings: Hospital staff and family members described several advantages of CCT. Bedside and hub staff strongly believed that the main advantage of CCT was having access to experts when bedside doctors were not available. Families also valued having access to critical care experts. Hospital staff also described how CCT could support clinical decision‐making and mentoring of junior staff.  Hospital staff greatly valued the nature and quality of social networks between the bedside and CCT hub teams. Key issues for them were trust, acceptance, being part of a team, familiarity and effective communication between the two teams. Interactions between some bedside and CCT hub staff were featured with tension, frustration and conflict. Staff on both sides commonly described disrespect of expertise, resistance and animosity. Hospital staff thought it was important to promote and offer training in the use of CCT before its implementation.

It is important to achieve the required sample size for a trial, otherwise trialists may not be able to draw conclusive results leading to research waste and raising ethical questions about trial participation. The reasons why potential participants may accept or decline participation are multifaceted. Yet, the evidence of effectiveness of interventions to improve recruitment to trials is not substantial and fails to recognise these individual decision‐making processes. It is important to synthesise the experiences and perceptions of those invited to participate in randomised trials to better inform recruitment strategies. Objectives To explore potential trial participants’ views and experiences of the recruitment process for participation. The specific objectives are to describe potential participants’ perceptions and experiences of accepting or declining to participate in trials, to explore barriers and facilitators to trial participation, and to explore to what extent barriers and facilitators identified are addressed by strategies to improve recruitment evaluated in previous reviews of the effects of interventions including a Cochrane Methodology Review. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos, LILACS, PsycINFO, ORRCA, and grey literature sources. We ran the most recent set of searches for which the results were incorporated into the review in July 2017. Selection criteria We included qualitative and mixed‐methods studies (with an identifiable qualitative component) that explored potential trial participants’ experiences and perceptions of being invited to participate in a trial. We excluded studies that focused only on recruiters’ perspectives, and trials solely involving children under 18 years, or adults who were assessed as having impaired mental capacity. Data collection and analysis Five review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by the search. We used the CART (completeness, accuracy, relevance, timeliness) criteria to exclude studies that had limited focus on the phenomenon of interest. We used QSR NVivo to extract and manage the data. We assessed methodological limitations using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used thematic synthesis to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided analytical themes and a conceptual model. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. Our findings were integrated with two previous intervention effectiveness reviews by juxtaposing the quantitative and qualitative findings in a matrix. Main results We included 29 studies (published in 30 papers) in our synthesis. Twenty‐two key findings were produced under three broad themes (with six subthemes) to capture the experience of being invited to participate in a trial and making the decision whether to participate. Most of these findings had moderate to high confidence. We identified factors from the trial itself that influenced participation. These included how trial information was communicated, and elements of the trial such as the time commitment that might be considered burdensome. The second theme related to personal factors such as how other people can influence the individual’s decision; and how a personal understanding of potential harms and benefits could impact on the decision. Finally, the potential benefits of participation were found to be key to the decision to participate, namely personal benefits such as access to new treatments, but also the chance to make a difference and help others. The conceptual model we developed presents the decision‐making process as a gauge and the factors that influence whether the person will, or will not, take part. Authors' conclusions This qualitative evidence synthesis has provided comprehensive insight into the complexity of factors that influence a person's decision whether to participate in a trial. We developed key questions that trialists can ask when developing their recruitment strategy. In addition, our conceptual model emphasises the need for participant‐centred approaches to recruitment. We demonstrated moderate to high level confidence in our findings, which in some way can be attributed to the large volume of highly relevant studies in this field. We recommend that these insights be used to direct or influence or underpin future recruitment strategies that are developed in a participant‐driven way that ultimately improves trial conduct and reduces research waste. Plain language summary What factors influence a person's decision whether or not to take part in a randomised trial? What is the aim of this review? Randomised trials are needed for understanding if and how different healthcare interventions (such as medicines, types of surgeries, health promotion activities, etc.) work or not. Getting people to take part in trials can be difficult and if not enough people participate, then the trial will not provide the information that it set out to. By learning more about what influences a person’s decision to take part in a trial, we can provide advice on how best to include people in trials. To answer this question, we brought together the findings of 29 studies reporting the views and experiences of people who had been invited to take part in a randomised trial. Key messages Several factors influence a person’s decision to take part in a trial including: how the trial is set up and communicated; people’s own personal circumstances; and the potential benefits of participation. It is important that those working in trials take these into account when inviting people to participate. It is important that this is done in a manner that recognises that all people are different and may consider the trial in a different way. What was studied in the review? We searched for studies that examined the views of those who had been invited to take part in a randomised trial. We included studies with people who had agreed to take part as well as those who had decided not to take part. We included studies published since the start of the year 2000. Our searches identified 29 studies (published in 30 papers) to include in this review. Sixteen studies were conducted in the UK, six in other European countries, three in the USA, one each in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Tanzania. The trials that people had been invited to take part in were for cancer (n = 7); pregnancy and childbirth (n = 5); medicine and surgery (n = 11); mental health (n = 2); and health promotion (n = 4). Our review pointed to three main factors that influenced whether potential participants agreed to take part in a trial or not. We judged the following findings to have moderate to high confidence. What are the main findings? People preferred to be invited in a face‐to‐face setting, with information communicated clearly. Written information was also useful. The timing of the invitation is important because potential participants could find it difficult to recognise the care they usually receive and care that would be provided as part of the trial. Commitment to the trial can make people worried about participating. Some believed that extra appointments and the time involved would be a burden. Sometimes people are offered money as a way to recompense them for their commitment. Payment was welcomed by some, but was not seen as a very important factor that influences their decision. If someone feels healthy, they may not wish to risk their health by taking part in a trial. However, if someone feels unwell, they may not want to risk making their health worse. On the other hand, someone who is healthy or very ill may feel they have “nothing to lose” by taking part in a trial, so it is not just about how healthy someone is but rather how they feel about their own health. Also, the person’s doctor or nurse may say something that influences their decision, as can something said by family, friends or in the media. It is important for the people recruiting someone to know who has influence when that person is making their decisions. People are influenced by the chance of improvement, the chance to feel better if the therapy or treatment works, or the opportunity to make a difference by helping others in the future. Inviting people to take part in a trial should be done in a way that considers each person individually, because there is no “one size fits all” when it comes to making this decision.

It is an effective smoking cessation aid in non‐pregnant smokers, but there is less evidence of effectiveness in pregnancy. Systematic review evidence suggests that pregnant women do not adhere to NRT as prescribed, which might undermine effectiveness. Electronic cigarettes (e‐cigarettes) have grown in popularity, but effectiveness and safety in pregnancy are not yet established. The determinants of uptake and use of NRT and e‐cigarettes in pregnancy are unknown. Objectives To explore factors affecting uptake and use of NRT and e‐cigarettes in pregnancy. Search methods We searched MEDLINE(R), CINAHL and PsycINFO on 1 February 2019. We manually searched OpenGrey database and screened references of included studies and relevant reviews. We also conducted forward citation searches of included studies. Selection criteria We selected studies that used qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, included women who had smoked in pregnancy, and elicited participants' views about using NRT/e‐cigarettes for smoking cessation or harm reduction (i.e. to smoke fewer cigarettes) during pregnancy. Data collection and analysis We identified determinants of uptake and use of NRT/e‐cigarettes in pregnancy using a thematic synthesis approach. Two review authors assessed the quality of included studies with the Wallace tool. Two review authors used the CERQual approach to assess confidence in review findings. The contexts of studies from this review and the relevant Cochrane effectiveness review were not similar enough to fully integrate findings; however, we created a matrix to juxtapose findings from this review with the descriptions of behavioural support from trials in the effectiveness review. Main results We included 21 studies: 15 focused on NRT, 3 on e‐cigarettes, and 3 on both. Studies took place in five high‐income countries. Most studies contributed few relevant data; substantially fewer data were available on determinants of e‐cigarettes. Many studies focused predominantly on issues relating to smoking cessation, and determinants of NRT/e‐cigarette use was often presented as one of the themes. We identified six descriptive themes and 18 findings within those themes; from these we developed three overarching analytical themes representing key determinants of uptake and adherence to NRT and/or e‐cigarettes in pregnancy. The analytical themes show that women's  desire to protect their unborn babies   from harm  is one of the main reasons they use these products. Furthermore, women consider  advice from health professionals  when deciding whether to use NRT or e‐cigarettes; when health professionals tell women that NRT or e‐cigarettes are safer than smoking and that it is okay for them to use these in pregnancy, women report feeling more confident about using them. Conversely, women who are told that NRT or e‐cigarettes are as dangerous or more dangerous than smoking and that they should not use them during pregnancy feel less confident about using them. Women's  past experiences with NRT  can also affect their willingness to use NRT in pregnancy; women who feel that NRT had worked for them (or someone they know) in the past were more confident about using it again. However, women who had negative experiences were more reluctant to use NRT. No trials on e‐cigarette use in pregnancy were included in the Cochrane effectiveness review, so we considered only NRT findings when integrating results from this review and the effectiveness review. No qualitative studies were conducted alongside trials, making full integration of the findings challenging. Women enrolled in trials would have agreed to being allocated to NRT or control group and would have received standardised information on NRT at the start of the trial. Overall, the findings of this synthesis are less relevant to women's decisions about starting NRT in trials and more likely to help explain trial participants' adherence to NRT after starting it. We considered most findings to be of moderate certainty; we assessed findings on NRT use as being of higher certainty than those on e‐cigarette use. This was mainly due to the limited data from fewer studies (only in the UK and USA) that contributed to e‐cigarette findings. Overall, we judged studies to be of acceptable quality with only minor methodological issues. Authors' conclusions Consistent messages from health professionals, based on high‐quality evidence and clearly explaining the safety of NRT and e‐cigarettes compared to smoking in pregnancy, could help women use NRT and e‐cigarettes more consistently/as recommended. This may improve their attitudes towards NRT or e‐cigarettes, increase their willingness to use these in their attempt to quit, and subsequently encourage them to stay smoke‐free. Plain language summary Factors affecting use of nicotine replacement therapy and e‐cigarettes in pregnancy What was studied in this review?  Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) delivers nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. NRT helps some non‐pregnant adults to stop smoking, but it does not seem to work so well in pregnancy. This may be because pregnant women generally do not use NRT as prescribed. Studies show that some pregnant women use e‐cigarettes to help them cut down or quit, although their safety and effectiveness in pregnancy is not known. Little is known about the issues that influence pregnant women's use of NRT/e‐cigarettes. What is the aim of this review?  To explore factors that affect whether women take up and use NRT or e‐cigarettes to reduce or quit smoking in pregnancy. What are the key messages of this review?  Three main factors influence whether women take up and use NRT and e‐cigarettes in pregnancy: advice women receive from health professionals on using NRT or e‐cigarette in pregnancy, women's desire to protect their unborn baby from harm, and past personal experience with NRT. Each of these factors can either encourage or discourage women from using these products. What are the key findings?  We included 21 studies; 15 of these focused on NRT, 3 on e‐cigarettes and 3 on both. Our findings suggest that women's desire to protect their unborn babies from harm is one of the main reasons they use these products. They also consider the advice from their health professionals; when professionals tell women that NRT or e‐cigarettes are safer than smoking and that it is okay to use them in pregnancy, their confidence about using them increases. When women are told that NRT or e‐cigarettes are as dangerous or more dangerous than smoking and that they should not use them when they are pregnant, they feel less confident about using them. Women's past experiences with NRT will also affect how willing they are to use NRT in pregnancy. For example, women who feel that NRT had worked for them (or someone they know) in the past were more confident about using it again. However, women who had negative experiences were more reluctant to use NRT. We conclude that consistent messages that are based on high‐quality research and clearly explain how safe NRT and e‐cigarettes are compared to smoking in pregnancy, could help women use NRT and e‐cigarettes more consistently/as recommended. This may improve their attitudes towards NRT or e‐cigarettes, increase their willingness to use these in their attempt to quit, and encourage them to stay smoke‐free. How up‐to‐date is this review?

When new respiratory infectious diseases become widespread, such as during the COVID‐19 pandemic, healthcare workers’ adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines becomes even more important. Strategies in these guidelines include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gloves and gowns; the separation of patients with respiratory infections from others; and stricter cleaning routines. These strategies can be difficult and time‐consuming to adhere to in practice. Authorities and healthcare facilities therefore need to consider how best to support healthcare workers to implement them. Objectives To identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers’ adherence to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. Search methods We searched OVID MEDLINE on 26 March 2020. As we searched only one database due to time constraints, we also undertook a rigorous and comprehensive scoping exercise and search of the reference lists of key papers. We did not apply any date limit or language limits. Selection criteria We included qualitative and mixed‐methods studies (with an identifiable qualitative component) that focused on the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers towards factors that impact on their ability to adhere to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. We included studies of any type of healthcare worker with responsibility for patient care. We included studies that focused on IPC guidelines (local, national or international) for respiratory infectious diseases in any healthcare setting. These selection criteria were framed by an understanding of the needs of health workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Data collection and analysis Four review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by the search. We used a prespecified sampling frame to sample from the eligible studies, aiming to capture diverse respiratory infectious disease types, geographical spread and data‐rich studies. We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this synthesis. We assessed methodological limitations using an adapted version of the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used a ‘best fit framework approach’ to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided upfront analytical categories, with scope for further thematic analysis. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and developed implications for practice. Main results We found 36 relevant studies and sampled 20 of these studies for our analysis. Ten of these studies were from Asia, four from Africa, four from Central and North America and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. Most of these healthcare workers worked in hospitals; others worked in primary and community care settings. The review points to several barriers and facilitators that influenced healthcare workers’ ability to adhere to IPC guidelines. The following factors are based on findings assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Healthcare workers felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were lengthy and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines. They could feel overwhelmed because local guidelines were constantly changing. They also described how IPC strategies led to increased workloads and fatigue, for instance because they had to use PPE and take on additional cleaning. Healthcare workers described how their responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the level of support they felt that they received from their management team. Clear communication about IPC guidelines was seen as vital. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They also thought it was a problem when training was not mandatory. Sufficient space to isolate patients was also seen as vital. A lack of isolation rooms, anterooms and shower facilities was identified as a problem. Other important practical measures described by healthcare workers included minimising overcrowding, fast‐tracking infected patients, restricting visitors, and providing easy access to handwashing facilities. A lack of PPE, and provision of equipment that was of poor quality, was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. They also pointed to the need to adjust the volume of supplies as infection outbreaks continued. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw its value. Some healthcare workers felt motivated to follow the guidance because of fear of infecting themselves or their families, or because they felt responsible for their patients. Some healthcare workers found it difficult to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened or stigmatised. Healthcare workers also found masks and other equipment uncomfortable to use. The workplace culture could also influence whether healthcare workers followed IPC guidelines or not. Across many of the findings, healthcare workers pointed to the importance of including all staff, including cleaning staff, porters, kitchen staff and other support staff when implementing IPC guidelines. Authors' conclusions Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors tied to the guideline itself and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment, and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all facility staff, including support staff, when implementing IPC guidelines. Plain language summary Factors that influence whether healthcare workers follow infection prevention and control guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases What is the aim of this review? Coronavirus (COVID‐19) is a respiratory infectious disease that has spread throughout the world. Healthcare workers treating patients with COVID‐19 are at risk of infecting themselves and others by breathing in droplets from infected patients and touching contaminated surfaces. Governments and organisations publish infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines to reduce transmission of infections. IPC guidelines cover using personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks, gloves, and gowns; separating patients with respiratory infections; and stricter cleaning routines. However, how much healthcare workers follow this guidance varies. The aim of this Cochrane review of qualitative research (“qualitative evidence synthesis”) was to explore what influences whether healthcare workers follow infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. To answer this question, we analysed 20 qualitative studies of healthcare workers' views and experiences of IPC guidelines. Key messages Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors linked to the guideline content and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment (PPE), and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all healthcare facilities staff when implementing guidelines. What was studied in this review? We searched for studies that examined healthcare workers’ views and experiences towards IPC guidelines – particularly for respiratory diseases that start suddenly, like COVID‐19. Guidelines could be local, national, or international, for any healthcare setting. We included studies of any healthcare worker who looked after patients in any healthcare setting. We searched for studies published from 2002 onwards to cover the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak onwards. What are the main findings of this review? We analysed 20 studies. Ten studies were from Asia, four each from Africa and North and Central America, and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with SARS, H1N1 (‘swine flu’), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), tuberculosis or seasonal influenza. Most healthcare workers worked in hospitals. Our review pointed to several factors that influenced healthcare workers’ adherence to IPC guidelines. We judged the following findings to be well supported or very well supported (moderate to high confidence) by the studies we found. Healthcare workers were unsure whether to follow local guidelines if they differed from national or international guidance. They struggled to follow long or unclear guidelines, especially if their advice was impractical or kept changing. Use of PPE and additional cleaning meant that following IPC guidelines increased workload and fatigue. Healthcare workers’ responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the support they received from management and their workplace culture. Healthcare workers emphasised the importance of clear communication about IPC guidelines. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They thought it was a problem when training was not compulsory and believed all staff, including cleaners, porters, kitchen and other support staff, should be included in IPC training. Insufficient space to isolate patients, and lack of anterooms, showers and easy access to handwashing facilities was a problem. Practical measures, such as minimising overcrowding, fast‐tracking infected patients and restricting visitors were important for reducing infection. Lack of, and poor‐quality, PPE was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. Supplies need to be adjusted as infection outbreaks continue. Healthcare workers found PPE uncomfortable to use and some found PPE made patients feel isolated and frightened. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw its value, for example, reducing the risk of infecting themselves and their families, or protecting their patients. Many factors affect healthcare workers’ willingness and ability to follow IPC guidelines. Our review includes a set of questions drawn from our findings to help healthcare providers plan, implement, or manage IPC strategies to help their workers follow IPC guidelines.

Within primary care, health workers often use mobile devices to register clients, track their health, and make decisions about care, as well as to communicate with clients and other health workers. An understanding of how health workers relate to, and experience mHealth, can help in its implementation. Objectives To synthesise qualitative research evidence on health workers' perceptions and experiences of using mHealth technologies to deliver primary healthcare services, and to develop hypotheses about why some technologies are more effective than others. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index in January 2018. We searched Global Health in December 2015. We screened the reference lists of included studies and key references and searched seven sources for grey literature (16 February to 5 March 2018). We re‐ran the search strategies in February 2020. We screened these records and any studies that we identified as potentially relevant are awaiting classification. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative data collection and analysis methods. We included studies of mHealth programmes that were part of primary healthcare services. These services could be implemented in public or private primary healthcare facilities, community and workplace, or the homes of clients. We included all categories of health workers, as well as those persons who supported the delivery and management of the mHealth programmes. We excluded participants identified as technical staff who developed and maintained the mHealth technology, without otherwise being involved in the programme delivery. We included studies conducted in any country. Data collection and analysis We assessed abstracts, titles and full‐text papers according to the inclusion criteria. We found 53 studies that met the inclusion criteria and sampled 43 of these for our analysis. For the 43 sampled studies, we extracted information, such as country, health worker category, and the mHealth technology. We used a thematic analysis process. We used GRADE‐CERQual to assess our confidence in the findings. Main results Most of the 43 included sample studies were from low‐ or middle‐income countries. In many of the studies, the mobile devices had decision support software loaded onto them, which showed the steps the health workers had to follow when they provided health care. Other uses included in‐person and/or text message communication, and recording clients' health information. Almost half of the studies looked at health workers' use of mobile devices for mother, child, and newborn health. We have moderate or high confidence in the following findings. mHealth changed how health workers worked with each other : health workers appreciated being more connected to colleagues, and thought that this improved co‐ordination and quality of care. However, some described problems when senior colleagues did not respond or responded in anger. Some preferred face‐to‐face connection with colleagues. Some believed that mHealth improved their reporting, while others compared it to ""big brother watching"". mHealth changed how health workers delivered care : health workers appreciated how mHealth let them take on new tasks, work flexibly, and reach clients in difficult‐to‐reach areas. They appreciated mHealth when it improved feedback, speed and workflow, but not when it was slow or time consuming. Some health workers found decision support software useful; others thought it threatened their clinical skills. Most health workers saw mHealth as better than paper, but some preferred paper. Some health workers saw mHealth as creating more work. mHealth led to new forms of engagement and relationships with clients and communities : health workers felt that communicating with clients by mobile phone improved care and their relationships with clients, but felt that some clients needed face‐to‐face contact. Health workers were aware of the importance of protecting confidential client information when using mobile devices. Some health workers did not mind being contacted by clients outside working hours, while others wanted boundaries. Health workers described how some community members trusted health workers that used mHealth while others were sceptical. Health workers pointed to problems when clients needed to own their own phones. Health workers' use and perceptions of mHealth could be influenced by factors tied to costs, the health worker, the technology, the health system and society, poor network access, and poor access to electricity : some health workers did not mind covering extra costs. Others complained that phone credit was not delivered on time. Health workers who were accustomed to using mobile phones were sometimes more positive towards mHealth. Others with less experience, were sometimes embarrassed about making mistakes in front of clients or worried about job security. Health workers wanted training, technical support, user‐friendly devices, and systems that were integrated into existing electronic health systems. The main challenges health workers experienced were poor network connections, access to electricity, and the cost of recharging phones. Other problems included damaged phones. Factors outside the health system also influenced how health workers experienced mHealth, including language, gender, and poverty issues. Health workers felt that their commitment to clients helped them cope with these challenges. Authors' conclusions Our findings propose a nuanced view about mHealth programmes. The complexities of healthcare delivery and human interactions defy simplistic conclusions on how health workers will perceive and experience their use of mHealth. Perceptions reflect the interplay between the technology, contexts, and human attributes. Detailed descriptions of the programme, implementation processes and contexts, alongside effectiveness studies, will help to unravel this interplay to formulate hypotheses regarding the effectiveness of mHealth. Plain language summary Health workers' perceptions and experiences of using mHealth technologies to deliver primary healthcare services: a qualitative evidence synthesis What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review of qualitative research was to explore how health workers view and experience the use of mobile phones and tablets when delivering primary healthcare services. To answer this, we analysed 43 studies about health workers' views and experiences of mobile health (mHealth) programmes. Key messages Health workers welcomed the benefits of mHealth, and described how they used mobile phones to improve their work and relationships with each other and with clients. However, they also experienced challenges, including poor network coverage and access to electricity. People implementing mHealth programmes should try to address these challenges and build on health workers' positive experiences. What was studied in this review? Health workers often use mobile phones and tablets to provide services. It is important to understand what health workers think about these devices, as this can affect the quality of services. We looked for studies that explored health workers' views and experiences of using mobile devices in primary care. What are the main findings of this review? We sampled 43 of the 53 included studies in this review. Most were from low‐ or middle‐income countries, and included both lay health workers and health professionals. Many used mobile phones or tablets when delivering health care to mothers, children or newborns. Many of the mobile devices had software that helped health workers follow the correct steps when providing services. Health workers also used mobile phones to communicate with clients, and to record clients' health information. We have moderate or high confidence in the following findings. mHealth changed how health workers worked with each other : health workers appreciated being more connected to colleagues, and thought that this improved co‐ordination and quality of care.

Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. Objectives To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). Search methods We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3‐6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. Data collection and analysis We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three‐step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. Main results We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income settings and sixteen in high‐income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information. Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence). For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables. Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. Authors' conclusions Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications. Plain language summary What are clients' experiences and perceptions of receiving health information via their mobile phones? What is the aim of this synthesis? The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore clients' views and experiences of being communicated with by the health system through their mobile phone. Our synthesis looked at communication about pregnancy, newborn, and child health, sexual health, and family planning. By synthesis we mean the bringing together and synthesising of results from primary qualitative studies into a larger whole. We collected all relevant studies and included 35 studies in the synthesis. This synthesis links to other Cochrane Reviews that assess the effectiveness of this type of targeted digital health communication. Key messages Many clients like receiving messages from the health services by mobile phone. However, some clients have problems receiving messages due to lack of network access, internet, or phone, or language, reading, or privacy issues. Clients' experiences are also influenced by message timing, frequency, content, and sender. What did we study in the synthesis? Governments and health systems are starting to use mobile phones to communicate with clients. When the information is targeted at particular people or groups of people, and when the health system decides when and what to communicate, this is called 'digital targeted client communication.' Common types of digital targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or to take their medicines. Other types include phone calls or video messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. We looked for studies of clients' views and experiences of targeted communication by mobile phone. We focused on communication with pregnant women and parents of young children, and with adults and teenagers about sexual health and family planning. What are the main findings of the synthesis? We included 35 studies from around the world. These studies showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). Others also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Languages issues as well as clients' skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme, and many people wanted a sender that they knew and trusted (moderate confidence).

However, both quality of care provision and rates of attendance vary widely between and within countries. Qualitative research can assess factors underlying variation, including acceptability, feasibility, and the values and beliefs that frame provision and uptake of ANC programmes.  This synthesis links to the Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness of different antenatal models of care. It was designed to inform the World Health Organization guidelines for a positive pregnancy experience and to provide insights for the design and implementation of improved antenatal care in the future. Objectives To identify, appraise, and synthesise qualitative studies exploring: · Women’s views and experiences of attending ANC; and factors influencing the uptake of ANC arising from women’s accounts; · Healthcare providers’ views and experiences of providing ANC; and factors influencing the provision of ANC arising from the accounts of healthcare providers. Search methods To find primary studies we searched MEDLINE, Ovid; Embase, Ovid; CINAHL, EbscoHost; PsycINFO, EbscoHost; AMED, EbscoHost; LILACS, VHL; and African Journals Online (AJOL) from January 2000 to February 2019. We handsearched reference lists of included papers and checked the contents pages of 50 relevant journals through Zetoc alerts received during the searching phase. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methodology and that met our quality threshold; that explored the views and experiences of routine ANC among healthy, pregnant and postnatal women or among healthcare providers offering this care, including doctors, midwives, nurses, lay health workers and traditional birth attendants; and that took place in any setting where ANC was provided.  We excluded studies of ANC programmes designed for women with specific complications. We also excluded studies of programmes that focused solely on antenatal education. Data collection and analysis Two authors undertook data extraction, logged study characteristics, and assessed study quality. We used meta‐ethnographic and Framework techniques to code and categorise study data. We developed findings from the data and presented these in a 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' (SoQF) table. We assessed confidence in each finding using GRADE‐CERQual. We used these findings to generate higher‐level explanatory thematic domains. We then developed two lines of argument syntheses, one from service user data, and one from healthcare provider data. In addition, we mapped the findings to relevant Cochrane effectiveness reviews to assess how far review authors had taken account of behavioural and organisational factors in the design and implementation of the interventions they tested. We also translated the findings into logic models to explain full, partial and no uptake of ANC, using the theory of planned behaviour. Main results We include 85 studies in our synthesis. Forty‐six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers. The studies took place in 41 countries, including eight high‐income countries, 18 middle‐income countries and 15 low‐income countries, in rural, urban and semi‐urban locations. We developed 52 findings in total and organised these into three thematic domains: socio‐cultural context (11 findings, five moderate‐ or high‐confidence); service design and provision (24 findings, 15 moderate‐ or high‐confidence); and what matters to women and staff (17 findings, 11 moderate‐ or high‐confidence) The third domain was sub‐divided into two conceptual areas; personalised supportive care, and information and safety. We also developed two lines of argument, using high‐ or moderate‐confidence findings: For women, initial or continued use of ANC depends on a perception that doing so will be a positive experience. This is a result of the provision of good‐quality local services that are not dependent on the payment of informal fees and that include continuity of care that is authentically personalised, kind, caring, supportive, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful of women’s need for privacy, and that allow staff to take the time needed to provide relevant support, information and clinical safety for the woman and the baby, as and when they need it. Women’s perceptions of the value of ANC depend on their general beliefs about pregnancy as a healthy or a risky state, and on their reaction to being pregnant, as well as on local socio‐cultural norms relating to the advantages or otherwise of antenatal care for healthy pregnancies, and for those with complications. Whether they continue to use ANC or not depends on their experience of ANC design and provision when they access it for the first time. The capacity of healthcare providers to deliver the kind of high‐quality, relationship‐based, locally accessible ANC that is likely to facilitate access by women depends on the provision of sufficient resources and staffing as well as the time to provide flexible personalised, private appointments that are not overloaded with organisational tasks. Such provision also depends on organisational norms and values that overtly value kind, caring staff who make effective, culturally‐appropriate links with local communities, who respect women’s belief that pregnancy is usually a normal life event, but who can recognise and respond to complications when they arise. Healthcare providers also require sufficient training and education to do their job well, as well as an adequate salary, so that they do not need to demand extra informal funds from women and families, to supplement their income, or to fund essential supplies. Authors' conclusions This review has identified key barriers and facilitators to the uptake (or not) of ANC services by pregnant women, and in the provision (or not) of good‐quality ANC by healthcare providers. It complements existing effectiveness reviews of models of ANC provision and adds essential insights into why a particular type of ANC provided in specific local contexts may or may not be acceptable, accessible, or valued by some pregnant women and their families/communities. Those providing and funding services should consider the three thematic domains identified by the review as a basis for service development and improvement. Such developments should include pregnant and postnatal women, community members and other relevant stakeholders. Plain language summary Provision and uptake of routine antenatal services What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis is to explore women’s and healthcare workers’ views and experiences of antenatal care. We collected and analysed all relevant qualitative studies to answer this question, and include 85 studies. The synthesis links to the Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness of different antenatal models of care. The synthesis was designed to inform the World Health Organization guidelines for a positive pregnancy experience. Key messages Three areas of antenatal care are important to both women and service providers in all regions of the world. These are: the need to recognise and take account of the socio‐cultural context in which care is provided; the need to ensure that service design and provision are appropriate, accessible, acceptable and of high quality: and that what matters to women and staff is personalised supportive care, information, and safety. What was studied in this review? Antenatal care is the health care women get while they are pregnant. During antenatal care visits, pregnant women are provided with support, reassurance, and information about pregnancy and birth, as well as tests and examinations to see if they and their baby are healthy. If any issues or problems are discovered, these can be managed during the clinic visit. If needed, women can be referred to other care providers. Different types of healthcare workers can give antenatal care. These include midwives, doctors, nurses, and, sometimes, traditional birth attendants. The World Health Organization recommends that all pregnant women get antenatal care, but pregnant women do not always use this care. This may be because they do not think it is important, or because they cannot get to the healthcare facility. It may also be because the antenatal care they receive is of poor quality or because they are badly treated when they are there. By looking at studies of women’s and healthcare workers’ views and experiences of antenatal care, we aimed to learn more about what might help women to use antenatal care, and what might stop them using it. What are the main findings of this review? We include 85 studies in our synthesis. Forty‐six studies explored the views and experiences of women who were pregnant or who had recently given birth. 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers, including lay or community health workers, and 22 studies included the views of both women and healthcare providers. The studies took place in eight high‐income countries, 18 middle‐income countries and 12 low‐income countries, in rural and urban locations. Our findings suggest that women use antenatal care if they find it is a positive experience that fits with their beliefs and values, is easy for them to access, affordable, and treats them as an individual. They want care that helps them to feel that they and their baby are safe, and that is provided by kind, caring, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful staff that have time to give them support and reassurance about the health and well‐being of them and their babies. They also value tests and treatments that are offered when they need them, and information and advice that is relevant to them. Our findings also suggest that healthcare staff want to be able to offer this kind of care. They would like to work in antenatal services that are properly funded, and that give them proper support, pay, training and education. They believe this will help them to have enough time to treat each pregnant woman as an individual, and to have the knowledge, skills resources and equipment to do their job well.

A Cochrane Review of effectiveness studies suggested that nurse‐led care probably leads to similar healthcare outcomes as care delivered by doctors. This finding highlights the need to explore the factors that affect the implementation of strategies to substitute doctors with nurses in primary care. In our qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), we focused on studies of nurses taking on tasks that are typically conducted by doctors working in primary care, including substituting doctors with nurses or expanding nurses' roles. Objectives (1) To identify factors influencing implementation of interventions to substitute doctors with nurses in primary care. (2) To explore how our synthesis findings related to, and helped to explain, the findings of the Cochrane intervention review of the effectiveness of substituting doctors with nurses. (3) To identify hypotheses for subgroup analyses for future updates of the Cochrane intervention review. Search methods We searched CINAHL and PubMed, contacted experts in the field, scanned the reference lists of relevant studies and conducted forward citation searches for key articles in the Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index databases, and 'related article' searches in PubMed. Selection criteria We constructed a maximum variation sample (exploring variables such as country level of development, aspects of care covered and the types of participants) from studies that had collected and analysed qualitative data related to the factors influencing implementation of doctor‐nurse substitution and the expansion of nurses' tasks in community or primary care worldwide. We included perspectives of doctors, nurses, patients and their families/carers, policymakers, programme managers, other health workers and any others directly involved in or affected by the substitution. We excluded studies that collected data using qualitative methods but did not analyse the data qualitatively. Data collection and analysis We identified factors influencing implementation of doctor‐nurse substitution strategies using a framework thematic synthesis approach. Two review authors independently assessed the methodological strengths and limitations of included studies using a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool. We assessed confidence in the evidence for the QES findings using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. We integrated our findings with the evidence from the effectiveness review of doctor‐nurse substitution using a matrix model. Finally, we identified hypotheses for subgroup analyses for updates of the review of effectiveness. Main results We included 66 studies (69 papers), 11 from low‐ or middle‐income countries and 55 from high‐income countries. These studies found several factors that appeared to influence the implementation of doctor‐nurse substitution strategies. The following factors were based on findings that we assessed as moderate or high confidence. Patients in many studies knew little about nurses' roles and the difference between nurse‐led and doctor‐led care. They also had mixed views about the type of tasks that nurses should deliver. They preferred doctors when the tasks were more 'medical' but accepted nurses for preventive care and follow‐ups. Doctors in most studies also preferred that nurses performed only 'non‐medical' tasks. Nurses were comfortable with, and believed they were competent to deliver a wide range of tasks, but particularly emphasised tasks that were more health promotive/preventive in nature. Patients in most studies thought that nurses were more easily accessible than doctors. Doctors and nurses also saw nurse‐doctor substitution and collaboration as a way of increasing people's access to care, and improving the quality and continuity of care. Nurses thought that close doctor‐nurse relationships and doctor's trust in and acceptance of nurses was important for shaping their roles. But nurses working alone sometimes found it difficult to communicate with doctors. Nurses felt they had gained new skills when taking on new tasks. But nurses wanted more and better training. They thought this would increase their skills, job satisfaction and motivation, and would make them more independent. Nurses taking on doctors' tasks saw this as an opportunity to develop personally, to gain more respect and to improve the quality of care they could offer to patients. Better working conditions and financial incentives also motivated nurses to take on new tasks. Doctors valued collaborating with nurses when this reduced their own workload. Doctors and nurses pointed to the importance of having access to resources, such as enough staff, equipment and supplies; good referral systems; experienced leaders; clear roles; and adequate training and supervision. But they often had problems with these issues. They also pointed to the huge number of documents they needed to complete when tasks were moved from doctors to nurses. Authors' conclusions Patients, doctors and nurses may accept the use of nurses to deliver services that are usually delivered by doctors. But this is likely to depend on the type of services. Nurses taking on extra tasks want respect and collaboration from doctors; as well as proper resources; good referral systems; experienced leaders; clear roles; and adequate incentives, training and supervision. However, these needs are not always met. Plain language summary What factors influence implementation of doctor‐nurse substitution strategies in primary care? What was the aim of the review? In this Cochrane Review of qualitative studies ('qualitative evidence synthesis'), we explored peoples' views and experiences of moving tasks from doctors to nurses in primary healthcare. We collected relevant studies on this topic and included 66 studies (69 papers). This synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that assesses the effectiveness of moving tasks from doctors to nurses in primary care. Key messages Patients, doctors and nurses may accept the use of nurses to deliver services that are usually delivered by doctors. But this is likely to depend on the type of services. Nurses taking on extra tasks want respect and collaboration from doctors; proper resources; good referral systems; experienced leaders; clear roles; and adequate incentives, training and supervision. However, these needs are not always met. What was studied in the review? Many people do not get the healthcare they need because of a lack of healthcare workers where they live. Governments across the world are trying different solutions to address this problem. One possible solution is to move tasks from more‐specialised to less‐specialised health workers, for instance, moving certain tasks from doctors to nurses. In this review, we looked for studies that explored how patients, nurses, doctors and others viewed and experienced these solutions, and what could influence their success. What were the main results of the review? We included 66 studies (69 papers) in our review, 11 from low‐ or middle‐income countries and 55 from high‐income countries.

A Cochrane systematic review of interventions by Bohren and colleagues, concluded that having a labour companion improves outcomes for women and babies. The presence of a labour companion is therefore regarded as an important aspect of improving quality of care during labour and childbirth; however implementation of the intervention is not universal. Implementation of labour companionship may be hampered by limited understanding of factors affecting successful implementation across contexts. Objectives The objectives of the review were to describe and explore the perceptions and experiences of women, partners, community members, healthcare providers and administrators, and other key stakeholders regarding labour companionship; to identify factors affecting successful implementation and sustainability of labour companionship; and to explore how the findings of this review can enhance understanding of the related Cochrane systematic review of interventions. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and POPLINE K4Health databases for eligible studies from inception to 9 September 2018. There were no language, date or geographic restrictions. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on women’s, partners’, family members’, doulas', providers', or other relevant stakeholders' perceptions and experiences of labour companionship; and were from any type of health facility in any setting globally. Data collection and analysis We used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed the confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. We used two approaches to integrate qualitative findings with the intervention review findings. We used a logic model to theorise links between elements of the intervention and health and well‐being outcomes. We also used a matrix model to compare features of labour companionship identified as important in the qualitative evidence synthesis with the interventions included in the intervention review. Main results We found 51 studies (52 papers), mostly from high‐income countries and mostly describing women's perspectives. We assessed our level of confidence in each finding using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. We had high or moderate confidence in many of our findings. Where we only had low or very low confidence in a finding, we have indicated this. Labour companions supported women in four different ways. Companions gave informational support by providing information about childbirth, bridging communication gaps between health workers and women, and facilitating non‐pharmacological pain relief. Companions were advocates, which means they spoke up in support of the woman. Companions provided practical support, including encouraging women to move around, providing massage, and holding her hand. Finally, companions gave emotional support, using praise and reassurance to help women feel in control and confident, and providing a continuous physical presence. Women who wanted a companion present during labour and childbirth needed this person to be compassionate and trustworthy. Companionship helped women to have a positive birth experience. Women without a companion could perceive this as a negative birth experience. Women had mixed perspectives about wanting to have a male partner present (low confidence). Generally, men who were labour companions felt that their presence made a positive impact on both themselves (low confidence) and on the relationship with their partner and baby (low confidence), although some felt anxious witnessing labour pain (low confidence). Some male partners felt that they were not well integrated into the care team or decision‐making. Doulas often met with women before birth to build rapport and manage expectations. Women could develop close bonds with their doulas (low confidence). Foreign‐born women in high‐income settings may appreciate support from community‐based doulas to receive culturally‐competent care (low confidence). Factors affecting implementation included health workers and women not recognising the benefits of companionship, lack of space and privacy, and fearing increased risk of infection (low confidence). Changing policies to allow companionship and addressing gaps between policy and practice were thought to be important (low confidence). Some providers were resistant to or not well trained on how to use companions, and this could lead to conflict. Lay companions were often not integrated into antenatal care, which may cause frustration (low confidence). We compared our findings from this synthesis to the companionship programmes/approaches assessed in Bohren’s review of effectiveness. We found that most of these programmes did not appear to address these key features of labour companionship. Authors' conclusions We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several of these review findings. Further research, especially in low‐ and middle‐income settings and with different cadres of healthcare providers, could strengthen the evidence for low‐ or very low‐confidence findings. Ahead of implementation of labour companionship, researchers and programmers should consider factors that may affect implementation, including training content and timing for providers, women and companions; physical structure of the labour ward; specifying clear roles for companions and providers; integration of companions; and measuring the impact of companionship on women’s experiences of care. Implementation research or studies conducted on labour companionship should include a qualitative component to evaluate the process and context of implementation, in order to better interpret results and share findings across contexts. Plain language summary Perceptions and experiences of labour companionship What is the aim of this synthesis? The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore how women, families, and health workers experience women going through labour and childbirth with a support person ('labour companion'). A labour companion may be the woman’s partner, family member, trained supporter (doula), or nurse/midwife. We collected and analysed all relevant qualitative studies to answer this question. This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review by Bohren and colleagues from 2017 that assesses the effect of continuous support for women during childbirth. Continuous support improves health and well‐being for women and babies but factors affecting successful implementation are not well understood. Key messages Labour companions provide women with information, practical, and emotional support, and can speak up in support of women. Companions can help women have a positive birth experience and need to be compassionate and trustworthy. However, not all women who want a labour companion have one, especially in lower‐resource settings. What was studied in this synthesis? We use the term 'labour companionship' to describe support provided to women during labour and childbirth. In high‐income countries, women are often accompanied by family members or a doula. But in health facilities in low‐ and middle‐income countries, women may not be allowed to have any support person, and may go through labour and childbirth alone. Bohren's review from 2017 shows that supporting women during childbirth has positive effects on women's experiences and on their health. We sought to understand how women, partners, and healthcare providers felt about labour companionship, and what factors might influence women's access to labour companionship. What are the main findings? We found 51 studies, mostly from high‐income countries and mostly describing women's perspectives. We assessed our level of confidence in each finding using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. We had high or moderate confidence in many of our findings.

A skilled birth attendant (SBA) is a health worker such as a midwife, doctor, or nurse who is trained to manage normal pregnancy and childbirth. (S)he is also trained to identify, manage, and refer any health problems that arise for mother and baby. The skills, attitudes and behaviour of SBAs, and the extent to which they work in an enabling working environment, impact on the quality of care provided. If any of these factors are missing, mothers and babies are likely to receive suboptimal care. Objectives To explore the views, experiences, and behaviours of skilled birth attendants and those who support them; to identify factors that influence the delivery of intrapartum and postnatal care in low‐ and middle‐income countries; and to explore the extent to which these factors were reflected in intervention studies. Search methods Our search strategies specified key and free text terms related to the perinatal period, and the health provider, and included methodological filters for qualitative evidence syntheses and for low‐ and middle‐income countries. We searched MEDLINE, OvidSP (searched 21 November 2016), Embase, OvidSP (searched 28 November 2016), PsycINFO, OvidSP (searched 30 November 2016), POPLINE, K4Health (searched 30 November 2016), CINAHL, EBSCOhost (searched 30 November 2016), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (searched 15 August 2013), Web of Science (searched 1 December 2016), World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library (searched 16 August 2013), and World Health Organization Global Health Library for WHO databases (searched 1 December 2016). Selection criteria We included qualitative studies that focused on the views, experiences, and behaviours of SBAs and those who work with them as part of the team. We included studies from all levels of health care in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Data collection and analysis One review author extracted data and assessed study quality, and another review author checked the data. We synthesised data using the best fit framework synthesis approach and assessed confidence in the evidence using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether the factors identified by health workers in our synthesis as important for providing maternity care were reflected in the interventions evaluated in the studies in a related intervention review. Main results We included 31 studies that explored the views and experiences of different types of SBAs, including doctors, midwives, nurses, auxiliary nurses and their managers. The included studies took place in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Our synthesis pointed to a number of factors affecting SBAs’ provision of quality care. The following factors were based on evidence assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Skilled birth attendants reported that they were not always given sufficient training during their education or after they had begun clinical work. Also, inadequate staffing of facilities could increase the workloads of skilled birth attendants, make it difficult to provide supervision and result in mothers being offered poorer care. In addition, SBAs did not always believe that their salaries and benefits reflected their tasks and responsibilities and the personal risks they undertook. Together with poor living and working conditions, these issues were seen to increase stress and to negatively affect family life. Some SBAs also felt that managers lacked capacity and skills, and felt unsupported when their workplace concerns were not addressed. Possible causes of staff shortages in facilities included problems with hiring and assigning health workers to facilities where they were needed; lack of funding; poor management and bureaucratic systems; and low salaries. Skilled birth attendants and their managers suggested factors that could help recruit, keep, and motivate health workers, and improve the quality of care; these included good‐quality housing, allowances for extra work, paid vacations, continuing education, appropriate assessments of their work, and rewards. Skilled birth attendants’ ability to provide quality care was also limited by a lack of equipment, supplies, and drugs; blood and the infrastructure to manage blood transfusions; electricity and water supplies; and adequate space and amenities on maternity wards. These factors were seen to reduce SBAs’ morale, increase their workload and infection risk, and make them less efficient in their work. A lack of transport sometimes made it difficult for SBAs to refer women on to higher levels of care. In addition, women’s negative perceptions of the health system could make them reluctant to accept referral. We identified some other factors that also may have affected the quality of care, which were based on findings assessed as of low or very low confidence. Poor teamwork and lack of trust and collaboration between health workers appeared to negatively influence care. In contrast, good collaboration and teamwork appeared to increase skilled birth attendants’ motivation, their decision‐making abilities, and the quality of care. Skilled birth attendants’ workloads and staff shortages influenced their interactions with mothers. In addition, poor communication undermined trust between skilled birth attendants and mothers. Authors' conclusions Many factors influence the care that SBAs are able to provide to mothers during childbirth. These include access to training and supervision; staff numbers and workloads; salaries and living conditions; and access to well‐equipped, well‐organised healthcare facilities with water, electricity, and transport. Other factors that may play a role include the existence of teamwork and of trust, collaboration, and communication between health workers and with mothers. Skilled birth attendants reported many problems tied to all of these factors. Plain language summary What factors influence the delivery of care by skilled birth attendants in low‐ and middle‐income countries? Review aim The aim of this Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence was to identify factors that influence the provision of care by skilled birth attendants. To answer this question, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies of skilled birth attendants’ views, experiences, and behaviour. This synthesis complements another Cochrane Review assessing the effect of strategies to promote women’s use of healthcare facilities when giving birth. Key messages Many factors influence the care that skilled birth attendants provide to mothers during childbirth. These include access to training and supervision; staff numbers and workloads; salaries and living conditions; and access to well‐equipped, well‐organised healthcare facilities with water, electricity, and transport. Other factors that may play a role include the existence of teamwork, trust, collaboration, and communication between health workers and with mothers. Skilled birth attendants reported many problems tied to these factors. What did we study in the synthesis? In low‐ and middle‐income countries, many mothers still die during childbirth. Women are encouraged to give birth in health facilities rather than at home so they can receive care from skilled birth attendants. A skilled birth attendant is a health worker such as a midwife, doctor, or nurse who is trained to manage a normal pregnancy and childbirth, and refer the mother and newborn when complications arise. By exploring skilled birth attendants’ views, experiences, and behaviour, this synthesis aimed to identify factors that can influence their ability to provide quality care. Main findings We included 31 studies conducted in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Participants were skilled birth attendants including doctors, midwives, nurses, auxiliary nurses and their managers. Our synthesis pointed to several factors that affected skilled birth attendants’ provision of quality care. The following factors are based on evidence assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Skilled birth attendants reported that they sometimes had insufficient training during their education or after they had begun work. Where facilities lacked staff, skilled birth attendants’ workloads could increase, it could become difficult to provide supervision, and mothers could receive poorer care. In addition, skilled birth attendants did not always believe that their salaries and benefits reflected their tasks and responsibilities and the personal risks they undertook. Together with poor living and working conditions, these issues could lead to stress and affect skilled birth attendants' family life. Some skilled birth attendants felt that managers lacked capacity and skills, and they felt unsupported when their workplace concerns were not addressed.

Skilled birth attendants and their managers suggested factors that could help recruit, keep, and motivate health workers, and improve the quality of their work; these included good‐quality housing, allowances for extra work, paid vacations, continued education, proper assessments of their work, and rewards. Skilled birth attendants’ ability to provide quality care was also limited by a lack of equipment, drugs, and supplies; blood and the infrastructure to manage blood transfusions; electricity and water supplies; and adequate space and amenities on maternity wards.

"CD011787.PUB2","Ames, HMR; Glenton, C; Lewin, S","Parents' and informal caregivers' views and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination: a synthesis of qualitative evidence","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Childhood vaccination is an effective way to prevent serious childhood illnesses, but many children do not receive all the recommended vaccines. There are various reasons for this; some parents lack access because of poor quality health services, long distances or lack of money. Other parents may not trust vaccines or the healthcare workers who provide them, or they may not see the need for vaccination due to a lack of information or misinformation about how vaccinations work and the diseases they can prevent. Communication with parents about childhood vaccinations is one way of addressing these issues. Communication can take place at healthcare facilities, at home or in the community. Communication can be two‐way, for example face‐to‐face discussions between parents and healthcare providers, or one‐way, for instance via text messages, posters or radio programmes. Some types of communication enable parents to actively discuss vaccines and their benefits and harms, as well as diseases they can prevent. Other communication types simply give information about vaccination issues or when and where vaccines are available. People involved in vaccine programmes need to understand how parents experience different types of communication about vaccination and how this influences their decision to vaccinate. Objectives The specific objectives of the review were to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring: parents' and informal caregivers' views and experiences regarding communication about childhood vaccinations and the manner in which it is communicated; and the influence that vaccination communication has on parents' and informal caregivers' decisions regarding childhood vaccination. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In‐process and Other Non‐Index Citations (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EbscoHOST), and Anthropology Plus (EbscoHost) databases for eligible studies from inception to 30 August 2016. We developed search strategies for each database, using guidelines developed by the Cochrane Qualitative Research Methods Group for searching for qualitative evidence as well as modified versions of the search developed for three related reviews of effectiveness. There were no date or geographic restrictions for the search. Selection criteria We included studies that utilised qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on the views and experiences of parents and informal caregivers regarding information about vaccination for children aged up to six years; and were from any setting globally where information about childhood vaccinations was communicated or distributed. Data collection and analysis We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, using a three‐step sampling frame. We conducted a thematic analysis using a constant comparison strategy for data extraction and synthesis. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. High confidence suggests that it is highly likely that the review finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest, while very low confidence indicates that it is not clear whether the review finding is a reasonable representation of it. Using a matrix model, we then integrated our findings with those from other Cochrane reviews that assessed the effects of different communication strategies on parents' knowledge, attitudes and behaviour about childhood vaccination. Main results We included 38 studies, mostly from high‐income countries, many of which explored mothers' perceptions of vaccine communication. Some focused on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence in the evidence). Lack of information led to worry and regret about vaccination decisions among some parents (moderate confidence). Parents wanted balanced information about vaccination benefits and harms (high confidence), presented clearly and simply (moderate confidence) and tailored to their situation (low confidence in the evidence). Parents wanted vaccination information to be available at a wider variety of locations, including outside health services (low confidence) and in good time before each vaccination appointment (moderate confidence). Parents viewed health workers as an important source of information and had specific expectations of their interactions with them (high confidence). Poor communication and negative relationships with health workers sometimes impacted on vaccination decisions (moderate confidence). Parents generally found it difficult to know which vaccination information source to trust and challenging to find information they felt was unbiased and balanced (high confidence). The amount of information parents wanted and the sources they felt could be trusted appeared to be linked to acceptance of vaccination, with parents who were more hesitant wanting more information (low to moderate confidence). Our synthesis and comparison of the qualitative evidence shows that most of the trial interventions addressed at least one or two key aspects of communication, including the provision of information prior to the vaccination appointment and tailoring information to parents' needs. None of the interventions appeared to respond to negative media stories or address parental perceptions of health worker motives. Authors' conclusions We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several review findings. Further research, especially in rural and low‐ to middle‐income country settings, could strengthen evidence for the findings where we had low or very low confidence. Planners should consider the timing for making vaccination information available to parents, the settings where information is available, the provision of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and parents' perceptions of health workers and the information provided. Plain language summary What are parents' and informal caregivers' views and experiences of communication about routine early childhood vaccination? The aim of this Cochrane review was to explore how parents experience communication about vaccination for children under six years of age. We searched for and analysed qualitative studies that could answer this question. Qualitative research explores how people perceive and experience the world around them. This review of qualitative research supplements other Cochrane reviews that assess the effect of different communication strategies on parents' knowledge, attitudes and behaviour about childhood vaccination. Key messages We are quite confident in the evidence we found that parents want clear, timely and balanced information, but that they often find this information to be lacking. The amount of information parents want and the sources they trust appear to be linked to their acceptance of vaccination; however, our confidence in this last finding is only low to moderate. What did we study in the review? Childhood vaccination is an effective way of preventing serious childhood illnesses. However, many children do not receive all of the recommended immunisations. There may be different reasons for this. Some parents do not have access to the vaccine, for instance because of poor quality health services, distance from their home to a health facility or lack of money. Some parents do not trust the vaccine itself or the healthcare worker who provides it, while others do not see the need to vaccinate their children at all. Parents may not know how vaccinations work or about the diseases that they prevent. They may also have received information that is misleading or incorrect. To address some of these issues, governments and health agencies often try to communicate with parents about childhood vaccinations. This communication can take place at healthcare facilities, at home or in the community. Communication can be two‐way, for instance face‐to‐face discussions between parents and healthcare providers. It can also involve one‐way communication, for instance information provided through text messaging, posters, leaflets, or radio or television programmes. Some types of communication allow parents to actively discuss the vaccine, its benefits and harms, and the disease it aims to prevent. Other types of communication simply give information about these issues or about when and where vaccines are available. People involved in vaccine programmes need to understand how parents experience different types of communication about vaccination and how this influences their decision to vaccinate their child. What are the main findings of the review? We included 38 studies in our review. Most of the studies were from high‐income countries and explored mothers' perceptions of vaccine communication. Some of the studies also included the views of fathers, grandmothers and other caregivers. In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence). For some parents, a lack of information led to worry and regret about their vaccination decision (moderate confidence). Parents wanted balanced information about both the benefits and risks of vaccination (high confidence), presented in a clear and simple manner (moderate confidence) and tailored to their situation (low confidence). Parents wanted vaccination information to be available outside of the health services (low confidence). They wanted this information in good time before each vaccination appointment and not while their child was being vaccinated (moderate confidence). Parents viewed health workers as an important source of information and had specific expectations of their interactions with them (high confidence). Poor communication and negative relationships with health workers sometimes impacted on vaccination decisions (moderate confidence). Parents generally found it difficult to know which vaccination information source to trust and found it difficult to find information that they felt was unbiased and balanced (high confidence). The amount of information parents wanted and the sources they felt they could trust seem to be linked to their acceptance of vaccination, with parents who were more hesitant wanting more information (low to moderate confidence).

"CD011812.PUB2","Jordan, J; Rose, L; Dainty, KN; Noyes, J; Blackwood, B","Factors that impact on the use of mechanical ventilation weaning protocols in critically ill adults and children: a qualitative evidence‐synthesis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2016","Abstract - Background Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a longer intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and higher mortality. Consequently, methods to improve ventilator weaning processes have been sought. Two recent Cochrane systematic reviews in ICU adult and paediatric populations concluded that protocols can be effective in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, but there was significant heterogeneity in study findings. Growing awareness of the benefits of understanding the contextual factors impacting on effectiveness has encouraged the integration of qualitative evidence syntheses with effectiveness reviews, which has delivered important insights into the reasons underpinning (differential) effectiveness of healthcare interventions. Objectives 1. To locate, appraise and synthesize qualitative evidence concerning the barriers and facilitators of the use of protocols for weaning critically‐ill adults and children from mechanical ventilation; 2. To integrate this synthesis with two Cochrane effectiveness reviews of protocolized weaning to help explain observed heterogeneity by identifying contextual factors that impact on the use of protocols for weaning critically‐ill adults and children from mechanical ventilation; 3. To use the integrated body of evidence to suggest the circumstances in which weaning protocols are most likely to be used. Search methods We used a range of search terms identified with the help of the SPICE (Setting, Perspective, Intervention, Comparison, Evaluation) mnemonic. Where available, we used appropriate methodological filters for specific databases. We searched the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, OVID, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, EBSCOHost, Web of Science Core Collection, ASSIA, IBSS, Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest and LILACS on the 26th February 2015. In addition, we searched: the grey literature; the websites of professional associations for relevant publications; and the reference lists of all publications reviewed. We also contacted authors of the trials included in the effectiveness reviews as well as of studies (potentially) included in the qualitative synthesis, conducted citation searches of the publications reporting these studies, and contacted content experts. We reran the search on 3rd July 2016 and found three studies, which are awaiting classification. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies that described: the circumstances in which protocols are designed, implemented or used, or both, and the views and experiences of healthcare professionals either involved in the design, implementation or use of weaning protocols or involved in the weaning of critically‐ill adults and children from mechanical ventilation not using protocols. We included studies that: reflected on any aspect of the use of protocols, explored contextual factors relevant to the development, implementation or use of weaning protocols, and reported contextual phenomena and outcomes identified as relevant to the effectiveness of protocolized weaning from mechanical ventilation. Data collection and analysis At each stage, two review authors undertook designated tasks, with the results shared amongst the wider team for discussion and final development. We independently reviewed all retrieved titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion, and independently extracted selected data from included studies. We used the findings of the included studies to develop a new set of analytic themes focused on the barriers and facilitators to the use of protocols, and further refined them to produce a set of summary statements. We used the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) framework to arrive at a final assessment of the overall confidence of the evidence used in the synthesis. We included all studies but undertook two sensitivity analyses to determine how the removal of certain bodies of evidence impacted on the content and confidence of the synthesis. We deployed a logic model to integrate the findings of the qualitative evidence synthesis with those of the Cochrane effectiveness reviews. Main results We included 11 studies in our synthesis, involving 267 participants (one study did not report the number of participants). Five more studies are awaiting classification and will be dealt with when we update the review. The quality of the evidence was mixed; of the 35 summary statements, we assessed 17 as ‘low’, 13 as ‘moderate’ and five as ‘high’ confidence. Our synthesis produced nine analytical themes, which report potential barriers and facilitators to the use of protocols. The themes are: the need for continual staff training and development; clinical experience as this promotes felt and perceived competence and confidence to wean; the vulnerability of weaning to disparate interprofessional working; an understanding of protocols as militating against a necessary proactivity in clinical practice; perceived nursing scope of practice and professional risk; ICU structure and processes of care; the ability of protocols to act as a prompt for shared care and consistency in weaning practice; maximizing the use of protocols through visibility and ease of implementation; and the ability of protocols to act as a framework for communication with parents. Authors' conclusions There is a clear need for weaning protocols to take account of the social and cultural environment in which they are to be implemented. Irrespective of its inherent strengths, a protocol will not be used if it does not accommodate these complexities. In terms of protocol development, comprehensive interprofessional input will help to ensure broad‐based understanding and a sense of ‘ownership’. In terms of implementation, all relevant ICU staff will benefit from general weaning as well as protocol‐specific training; not only will this help secure a relevant clinical knowledge base and operational understanding, but will also demonstrate to others that this knowledge and understanding is in place. In order to maximize relevance and acceptability, protocols should be designed with the patient profile and requirements of the target ICU in mind. Predictably, an under‐resourced ICU will impact adversely on protocol implementation, as staff will prioritize management of acutely deteriorating and critically‐ill patients. Plain language summary Using qualitative evidence to identify factors influencing ICU health carers' use of guidelines to take adults and children off mechanical ventilation Background Many critically‐ill adults and children being cared for in an intensive care unit (ICU) are unable to breathe by themselves. When this happens they are put on a mechanical ventilator, a machine that helps them to breathe. Staying on a ventilator for too long increases the likelihood of harmful effects, including trauma and infection of the lungs and complications of prolonged immobility such as blood clots in the legs or lungs. Consequently, researchers have tried to find ways to take people off ventilators (that is, to wean them) as soon as is safely possible. One way is by using guidelines, or  protocols.  Two recent Cochrane reviews combined evidence from different research studies. Some studies showed that protocols were successful in reducing the amount of time spent on a ventilator, while other studies showed that using protocols did not make any difference to the amount of time spent on a ventilator. These contrasting findings could have been caused by a range of factors. Researchers investigating these factors have used qualitative research methods, which usually involve talking to people or observing how people behave, or both. Review question What are the factors influencing how healthcare professionals use protocols to wean adults and children from mechanical ventilation? Methods To identify studies using qualitative methods, we searched relevant electronic databases of journals in February 2015. We also searched the reference lists of articles, contacted the authors of all of the studies included in the two earlier reviews and in our qualitative synthesis, and contacted experts in mechanical ventilation. We combined the findings of the relevant studies to produce a synthesis of the evidence on what influences health professionals to use protocols. We then combined our synthesis with the findings of the two earlier reviews to help explain why some of the studies had shown protocols to be effective and others had not. We were able to do so by producing explanations of how different factors work together to either promote or hinder the use of protocols. We outlined these explanations in a ‘logic model’. Key findings Our synthesis included 11 studies, involving around 267 participants; five more studies are awaiting classification. We identified several potential barriers and facilitators to the use of protocols. First, doctors used protocols only in certain circumstances; otherwise they preferred to wean using their own knowledge and skills. Relatively inexperienced nurses often lacked confidence. A protocol could encourage their involvement in weaning because it set out clear instructions and also helped them to feel more secure. Although more experienced nurses also recognized these positive qualities, they criticized protocols as sometimes instructing them to wean contrary to their own clinical judgement. Second, the practical arrangements for care within an ICU could either help or hinder healthcare professionals to work together, and in this way influence how (well) a protocol was used. Third, the use of a protocol reflected how healthcare professionals interact with one another generally. For example, the degree of experience a nurse or doctor possessed could influence the confidence others had that they could wean safely. For this reason, doctors tended to be reluctant to involve nurses they considered to be relatively inexperienced in weaning, even when there was a protocol in place. Furthermore, the fact that doctors occupied a higher professional status or position meant that it was difficult for nurses to be involved in weaning, including by using a protocol, unless the doctors s/he worked with permitted this to happen. Quality of the evidence We developed 35 summary statements. Of these: we assessed 17 statements as ‘low’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from only a small number of studies. We rated 13 statements as ‘moderate’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from very well‐conducted studies, and we rated five statements as ‘high’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from a majority of the studies.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Critical Care; Adult; Child; Clinical Protocols; Critical Illness; Evidence‐Based Practice; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Qualitative Research; Respiration, Artificial [adverse effects]; Staff Development; Ventilator Weaning [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD011812.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011812.pub2","Emergency and Critical Care"
"CD010414.PUB2","Glenton, C; Colvin, CJ; Carlsen, B; Swartz, A; Lewin, S; Noyes, J; Rashidian, A","Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of lay health worker programmes to improve access to maternal and child health: a qualitative evidence synthesis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2013","Abstract - Background Lay health workers (LHWs) perform functions related to healthcare delivery, receive some level of training, but have no formal professional or paraprofessional certificate or tertiary education degree. They provide care for a range of issues, including maternal and child health. For LHW programmes to be effective, we need a better understanding of the factors that influence their success and sustainability. This review addresses these issues through a synthesis of qualitative evidence and was carried out alongside the Cochrane review of the effectiveness of LHWs for maternal and child health. Objectives The overall aim of the review is to explore factors affecting the implementation of LHW programmes for maternal and child health. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, OvidSP (searched 21 December 2011); MEDLINE Ovid In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, OvidSP (searched 21 December 2011); CINAHL, EBSCO (searched 21 December 2011); British Nursing Index and Archive, OvidSP (searched 13 May 2011). We searched reference lists of included studies, contacted experts in the field, and included studies that were carried out alongside the trials from the LHW effectiveness review. Selection criteria Studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis and that focused on the experiences and attitudes of stakeholders regarding LHW programmes for maternal or child health in a primary or community healthcare setting. Data collection and analysis We identified barriers and facilitators to LHW programme implementation using the framework thematic synthesis approach. Two review authors independently assessed study quality using a standard tool. We assessed the certainty of the review findings using the CerQual approach, an approach that we developed alongside this and related qualitative syntheses. We integrated our findings with the outcome measures included in the review of LHW programme effectiveness in a logic model. Finally, we identified hypotheses for subgroup analyses in future updates of the review of effectiveness. Main results We included 53 studies primarily describing the experiences of LHWs, programme recipients, and other health workers. LHWs in high income countries mainly offered promotion, counselling and support. In low and middle income countries, LHWs offered similar services but sometimes also distributed supplements, contraceptives and other products, and diagnosed and treated children with common childhood diseases. Some LHWs were trained to manage uncomplicated labour and to refer women with pregnancy or labour complications. Many of the findings were based on studies from multiple settings, but with some methodological limitations. These findings were assessed as being of moderate certainty. Some findings were based on one or two studies and had some methodological limitations. These were assessed have low certainty. Barriers and facilitators were mainly tied to programme acceptability, appropriateness and credibility; and health system constraints. Programme recipients were generally positive to the programmes, appreciating the LHWs’ skills and the similarities they saw between themselves and the LHWs. However, some recipients were concerned about confidentiality when receiving home visits. Others saw LHW services as not relevant or not sufficient, particularly when LHWs only offered promotional services. LHWs and recipients emphasised the importance of trust, respect, kindness and empathy. However, LHWs sometimes found it difficult to manage emotional relationships and boundaries with recipients. Some LHWs feared blame if care was not successful. Others felt demotivated when their services were not appreciated. Support from health systems and community leaders could give LHWs credibility, at least if the health systems and community leaders had authority and respect. Active support from family members was also important. Health professionals often appreciated the LHWs’ contributions in reducing their workload and for their communication skills and commitment. However, some health professionals thought that LHWs added to their workload and feared a loss of authority. LHWs were motivated by factors including altruism, social recognition, knowledge gain and career development. Some unsalaried LHWs wanted regular payment, while others were concerned that payment might threaten their social status or lead recipients to question their motives. Some salaried LHWs were dissatisfied with their pay levels. Others were frustrated when payment differed across regions or institutions. Some LHWs stated that they had few opportunities to voice complaints. LHWs described insufficient, poor quality, irrelevant and inflexible training programmes, calling for more training in counselling and communication and in topics outside their current role, including common health problems and domestic problems. LHWs and supervisors complained about supervisors’ lack of skills, time and transportation. Some LHWs appreciated the opportunity to share experiences with fellow LHWs. In some studies, LHWs were traditional birth attendants who had received additional training. Some health professionals were concerned that these LHWs were over‐confident about their ability to manage danger signs. LHWs and recipients pointed to other problems, including women’s reluctance to be referred after bad experiences with health professionals, fear of caesarean sections, lack of transport, and cost. Some LHWs were reluctant to refer women on because of poor co‐operation with health professionals. We organised these findings and the outcome measures included in the review of LHW programme effectiveness in a logic model. Here we proposed six chains of events where specific programme components lead to specific intermediate or long‐term outcomes, and where specific moderators positively or negatively affect this process. We suggest how future updates of the LHW effectiveness review could explore whether the presence of these components influences programme success. Authors' conclusions Rather than being seen as a lesser trained health worker, LHWs may represent a different and sometimes preferred type of health worker. The close relationship between LHWs and recipients is a programme strength. However, programme planners must consider how to achieve the benefits of closeness while minimizing the potential drawbacks. Other important facilitators may include the development of services that recipients perceive as relevant; regular and visible support from the health system and the community; and appropriate training, supervision and incentives. Plain language summary Factors that can influence the success of lay health worker programmes for maternal and child health This review was carried out by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration. It summarises the findings of 53 studies that explore factors influencing the success of lay health worker (LHW) programmes for mothers and child health. This review was carried out alongside the Cochrane review assessing the effectiveness of LHW programmes on maternal and child health. What is a lay health worker? A LHW is a lay person who has received some training to deliver healthcare services but is not a health professional. In most of the studies in this review, LHWs offered health care to people who were on low incomes living in wealthy countries or to people living in poor countries. The LHWs in wealthy countries offered health promotion, counselling and support. The LHWs in poor countries offered similar services but they sometimes also distributed food supplements, contraceptives and other products, treated children with common childhood diseases, or managed women in uncomplicated labour. What the research says The studies described the experiences of LHWs, mothers, programme managers, and other health workers with LHW programmes. Many of our findings were based on studies from different settings and had some methodological problems. We judged these findings to have moderate certainty. Some findings were only based on one or two studies that had some methodological problems and were judged to be of low certainty. Mothers were generally positive about the programmes. They appreciated the LHWs’ skills and the similarities they saw between themselves and the LHWs. However, some mothers were concerned about confidentiality when receiving home visits. Others saw LHW services as not relevant or not sufficient, particularly when LHWs only offered promotional services. LHWs and mothers emphasised the importance of trust, respect, kindness and empathy. However, LHWs sometimes found it difficult to manage emotional relationships and boundaries with mothers. Some LHWs feared blame if health care was not successful. Others felt demotivated when their services were not appreciated. Support from health systems and community leaders could give LHWs credibility if these health systems and community leaders had authority and respect. Active support from family members was also important. Health professionals often appreciated the LHWs' contributions to reducing their workload, and their communication skills and commitment. However, some health professionals thought that LHWs added to their own workloads and feared a loss of authority. LHWs were motivated by altruism, social recognition, knowledge gain and career development. Some unsalaried LHWs wanted regular payment. Others were concerned that payment might threaten their social status or lead people to question their motives. Some salaried LHWs were dissatisfied with their pay levels. Others were frustrated when other LHWs had higher salaries. Some LHWs said that they had few opportunities to voice complaints. Some LHWs described insufficient, poor quality and irrelevant training programmes. They called for more training in counselling and communication and in topics outside their current role, including common health problems and domestic problems. LHWs and supervisors complained about supervisors’ lack of skills, time and transportation. Some LHWs appreciated the opportunity to share experiences with other LHWs. Some LHWs were traditional birth attendants who had received additional training. Some health professionals were concerned that these LHWs were over‐confident about their ability to manage danger signs. LHWs and mothers identified women’s reluctance to be referred after bad experiences with health professionals, fear of caesarean sections, lack of transport, and costs. Some LHWs were also reluctant to refer women on because of poor co‐operation with health professionals. We organized these findings into chains of events where we have proposed how certain LHW programme elements might lead to greater programme success. Authors’ conclusions Rather than being seen as a lesser trained health worker, LHWs represent a different and sometimes preferred type of health worker. The often close relationship between LHWs and their recipients is a strength of such programmes. However, programme planners must consider how to achieve the benefits of closeness while avoiding the problems. It may also be important to offer services that recipients perceive as relevant; to ensure regular and visible support from other health workers and community leaders; and to offer appropriate training, supervision and incentives.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Child Health Services; *Community Health Workers [education, psychology, supply & distribution]; *Health Services Accessibility; *Maternal Health Services; Adult; Attitude; Child; Female; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care [psychology]; Program Evaluation; Qualitative Research; Salaries and Fringe Benefits","10.1002/14651858.CD010414.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010414.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"
