It is characterised by non‐inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts). Lesions may be present on the face, thorax, and back, with variable severity. Acne exhibits a global distribution and has a growing prevalence. Acne vulgaris is the most common form. Acne gives rise to complications such as scars and can seriously affect people’s mental health, especially those with severe acne. Acne has a huge impact on the quality of life and self‐esteem of those affected. Objectives To synthesise the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of non‐systemic pharmacological interventions and non‐pharmacological interventions (physical therapy and complementary therapies) in the treatment of acne vulgaris and related skin complications. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, and Embase to 2 December 2021, and checked the reference lists of included reviews. At least two authors were responsible for screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. We excluded reviews with high risk of bias as assessed with the ROBIS tool. We evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence according to GRADE (as carried out by the authors of the included reviews or ourselves). We provide comprehensive evidence from the review data, including summary of findings tables, summary of results tables, and evidence maps. Main results We retrieved and assessed a total of 733 records; however, only six reviews (five Cochrane reviews and one non‐Cochrane review) with low risk of bias met the overview inclusion criteria. The six reviews involved 40,910 people with acne from 275 trials and 1316 people with acne scars from 37 trials. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 59 years, with an average age range from 18 to 30 years. Four reviews included original trials involving only female participants and three reviews included original trials with only male participants. Main results for clinically important comparisons: Benzoyl peroxide versus placebo or no treatment: In two trials involving 1012 participants over 12 weeks, benzoyl peroxide may reduce the total (mean difference (MD) ‐16.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐26.51 to ‐5.78), inflammatory (MD ‐6.12, 95% CI ‐11.02 to ‐1.22), and non‐inflammatory lesion counts (MD ‐9.69, 95% CI ‐15.08 to ‐4.29) when compared to placebo (long‐term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). Two trials including 1073 participants (time point: 10 and 12 weeks) suggested benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect in improving participants' global self‐assessment compared to placebo (long‐term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.22; very low‐certainty evidence). Very low‐certainty evidence suggested that benzoyl peroxide may improve investigators' global assessment (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28; 6 trials, 4110 participants, long‐term treatment (12 weeks)) compared to placebo. Thirteen trials including 4287 participants over 10 to 12 weeks suggested benzoyl peroxide may increase the risk of a less serious adverse event compared to placebo (long‐term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; very low‐certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical retinoids: Benzoyl peroxide may increase the percentage change in total lesion count compared to adapalene (long‐term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 10.8, 95% CI 3.38 to 18.22; 1 trial, 205 participants, 12 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence). When compared to adapalene, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long‐term treatment): percentage change in inflammatory lesion counts (MD ‐7.7, 95% CI ‐16.46 to 1.06; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence), percentage change in non‐inflammatory lesion counts (MD ‐3.9, 95% CI ‐13.31 to 5.51; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence), participant's global self‐assessment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 4 trials, 1123 participants, 11 to 12 weeks; low‐certainty evidence), investigators' global assessment (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.37; 3 trials, 1965 participants, 12 weeks; low‐certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25, 1573 participants, 5 trials, 11 to 12 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical antibiotics: When compared to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long‐term treatment): total lesion counts (MD ‐3.50, 95% CI ‐7.54 to 0.54; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence), inflammatory lesion counts (MD ‐1.20, 95% CI ‐2.99 to 0.59; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence), non‐inflammatory lesion counts (MD ‐2.4, 95% CI ‐5.3 to 0.5; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence), participant's global self‐assessment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 trial, 240 participants, 10 weeks; low‐certainty evidence), investigator's global assessment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.45; 2 trials, 2277 participants, 12 weeks; very low‐certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.64; 5 trials, 2842 participants, 10 to 12 weeks; low‐certainty evidence). For these clinically important comparisons, no review collected data for the following outcomes: frequency of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event or quality of life. No review collected data for the following comparisons: topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment, topical retinoids versus placebo or no treatment, or topical retinoids versus topical antibiotics. Authors' conclusions This overview summarises the evidence for topical therapy, phototherapy, and complementary therapy for acne and acne scars. We found no high‐certainty evidence for the effects of any therapy included. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews related to acne and acne scars had limitations (low methodological quality). We could not summarise the evidence for topical retinoids and topical antibiotics due to insufficient high‐quality systematic reviews. Future research should consider pooled analysis of data on new emerging drugs for acne treatment (e.g. clascoterone) and focus more on acne complications. Plain language summary Topical, light‐based, and complementary interventions: which works better to treat acne and its complications? Key messages • We did not find enough good‐quality evidence about benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, and topical retinoids for treating acne. We found that the included systematic reviews only provided a small amount of evidence on these clinically important drugs for us to summarise. • Future research should focus on areas that are important to patients, researchers, and decision‐makers, such as new drugs for acne treatment, topical antibiotics and retinoids, and acne complications, including scars and psychological distress. What is acne and its complications? Acne is a common inflammatory skin disease that occurs across all age groups, but mainly in young people. People with acne experience blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples. It mainly appears on the face, but can also appear on the back and chest. The main complication of acne is long‐lasting acne scars. Another is psychological distress. Some people with acne value their self‐image and acne may affect their mood, causing anxiety, depression, and even suicide. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if topical therapy (a medicine in the form of a cream, foam, gel, lotion, or ointment that is put onto the surface of the skin), light therapy (a treatment method using different colours of light to irradiate the skin lesion (damaged) area), and complementary therapy (an additional therapy other than conventional medicine, such as acupuncture, diet, and herbal medicine) have an effect by reducing lesion counts, improving acne severity as assessed by the participant and investigator, improving quality of life, and reducing serious or less serious adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. What did we do? We searched for systematic reviews that looked at topical, light‐based, and complementary interventions for acne and acne scars. We summarised the results of the systematic reviews and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? This overview includes six systematic reviews, involving 40,910 people with acne from 275 studies and 1316 people with acne scars from 37 studies. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 59 years, with the average age ranging from 18 to 30 years. Four reviews included original trials involving only female participants and three reviews included original trials with only male participants. We do not know if benzoyl peroxide, when compared with placebo or no treatment, has an effect on lesion counts, acne severity as assessed by the participant and investigator, or the rate of less serious adverse events. For the comparison between benzoyl peroxide and placebo or no treatment, we found no reviews to help us answer our question about serious adverse events or quality of life. We do not know if benzoyl peroxide, when compared with adapalene (a topical retinoid: one of the most common drugs for treating acne), has an effect on lesion counts and less serious adverse events. Benzoyl peroxide may make little to no difference to acne severity as assessed by the participant (1123 people in four studies) or the investigator (1965 people in three studies) when compared with adapalene. For the comparison between benzoyl peroxide and adapalene, we found no reviews to help us answer our question about serious adverse events or quality of life. It is unclear if benzoyl peroxide, when compared to clindamycin (a topical antibiotic: a medicine that kills bacteria and fungi, or stops bacteria growing), has an effect on lesion counts or the investigator's assessment of acne severity. Compared with clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide may make little to no difference to the participant's self‐assessment of acne severity (240 people in one study) or the rate of less serious adverse events (2842 people in five studies). For the comparison between benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin, we found no reviews to help us answer our question about serious adverse events or quality of life. We found no reviews to help us answer our question for the following comparisons: topical antibiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, topical retinoids compared with placebo or no treatment, and topical retinoids compared with topical antibiotics. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have little to very little confidence in our findings, and the results of further research could change the results of this overview. The main factors that reduced our confidence in the evidence are as follows. Firstly, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Secondly, not all the studies provided data about everything that they were interested in. Thirdly, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for the outcomes we were looking at. Finally, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Acne Vulgaris [complications, diagnosis, therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Benzoyl Peroxide [administration & dosage]; Bias; Child; Complementary Therapies [methods]; Dermatologic Agents [administration & dosage]; Female; Humans; Male; Phototherapy [methods]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD014918.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014918.pub2","Central Editorial Service"

Pulmonary inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of BPD, explaining the rationale for investigating postnatal corticosteroids. Multiple systematic reviews (SRs) have summarised the evidence from numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating different aspects of administrating postnatal corticosteroids. Besides beneficial effects on the outcome of death or BPD, potential short‐ and long‐term harms have been reported. Objectives The primary objective of this overview was to summarise and appraise the evidence from SRs regarding the efficacy and safety of postnatal corticosteroids in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Epistemonikos for SRs in April 2023. We included all SRs assessing any form of postnatal corticosteroid administration in preterm populations with the objective of ameliorating pulmonary disease. All regimens and comparisons were included. Two review authors independently checked the eligibility of the SRs comparing corticosteroids with placebo, and corticosteroids with different routes of administration and regimens. The included outcomes, considered key drivers in the decision to administer postnatal corticosteroids, were the composite outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA), its individual components, long‐term neurodevelopmental sequelae, sepsis, and gastrointestinal tract perforation. We independently assessed the methodological quality of the included SRs by using AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and ROBIS (Risk Of Bias In Systematic reviews) tools. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We provided a narrative description of the characteristics, methodological quality, and results of the included SRs. Main results We included nine SRs (seven Cochrane, two non‐Cochrane) containing 87 RCTs, 1 follow‐up study, and 9419 preterm infants, investigating the effects of postnatal corticosteroids to prevent or treat BPD. The quality of the included SRs according to AMSTAR 2 varied from high to critically low. Risk of bias according to ROBIS was low. The certainty of the evidence according to GRADE ranged from very low to moderate. Early initiated systemic dexamethasone (< seven days after birth) likely has a beneficial effect on death or BPD at 36 weeks' PMA (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.95; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 10 to 41; I 2  = 39%; 17 studies; 2791 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and on BPD at 36 weeks' PMA (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82; NNTB 13, 95% CI 9 to 21; I 2  = 39%; 17 studies; 2791 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Early initiated systemic hydrocortisone may also have a beneficial effect on death or BPD at 36 weeks’ PMA (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99; NNTB 18, 95% CI 9 to 594; I 2  = 43%; 9 studies; 1376 infants; low‐certainty evidence). However, these benefits are likely accompanied by harmful effects like cerebral palsy or neurosensory disability (dexamethasone) or gastrointestinal perforation (both dexamethasone and hydrocortisone). Late initiated systemic dexamethasone (≥ seven days after birth) may have a beneficial effect on death or BPD at 36 weeks' PMA (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84; NNTB 5, 95% CI 4 to 9; I 2  = 61%; 12 studies; 553 infants; low‐certainty evidence), mostly contributed to by a beneficial effect on BPD at 36 weeks' PMA (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.87; NNTB 6, 95% CI 4 to 13; I 2  = 14%; 12 studies; 553 infants; low‐certainty evidence). No harmful side effects were shown in the outcomes chosen as key drivers to the decision to start or withhold late systemic dexamethasone. No effects, either beneficial or harmful, were found in the subgroup meta‐analyses of late hydrocortisone studies. Early initiated inhaled corticosteroids probably have a beneficial effect on death and BPD at 36 weeks' PMA (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; NNTB 19, 95% CI not applicable; I 2  = 0%; 6 studies; 1285 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence), with no apparent adverse effects shown in the SRs. In contrast, late initiated inhaled corticosteroids do not appear to have any benefits or harms. Endotracheal instillation of corticosteroids (budesonide) with surfactant as a carrier likely has a beneficial effect on death or BPD at 36 weeks' PMA (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 6; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies; 381 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and on BPD at 36 weeks' PMA. No evidence of harmful effects was found. There was little evidence for effects of different starting doses or timing of systemic corticosteroids on death or BPD at 36 weeks' PMA, but potential adverse effects were observed for some comparisons. Lowering the dose might result in a more unfavourable balance of benefits and harms. Moderately early initiated systemic corticosteroids, compared with early systemic corticosteroids, may result in a higher incidence of BPD at 36 weeks' PMA. Pulse dosing instead of continuous dosing may have a negative effect on death and BPD at 36 weeks' PMA. We found no differences for the comparisons of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids. Authors' conclusions This overview summarises the evidence of nine SRs investigating the effect of postnatal corticosteroids in preterm infants at risk for BPD. Late initiated (≥ seven days after birth) systemic administration of dexamethasone is considered an effective intervention to reduce the risk of BPD in infants with a high risk profile for BPD, based on a favourable balance between benefits and harms. Endotracheal instillation of corticosteroids (budesonide) with surfactant as a carrier is a promising intervention, based on the beneficial effect on desirable outcomes without (so far) negative side effects. Pending results of ongoing large, multicentre RCTs investigating both short‐ and long‐term effects, endotracheal instillation of corticosteroids (budesonide) with surfactant as a carrier is not appropriate for clinical practice at present. Early initiated (< seven days after birth) systemic dexamethasone and hydrocortisone and late initiated (≥ seven days after birth) hydrocortisone are considered ineffective interventions, because of an unfavourable balance between benefits and harms. No conclusions are possible regarding early and late inhaled corticosteroids, as more research is needed. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of treating preterm infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia with corticosteroids? Key messages Treatment with dexamethasone  after the first week of life  is, at present, the only effective treatment in babies at high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Giving corticosteroids directly into the windpipe, together with surfactant, might be a promising treatment in the future. Treatment with dexamethasone  in the first week of life  and treatment with hydrocortisone at  any time after birth  are ineffective or possibly unsafe. What is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)? Babies who are born too early or preterm have an increased risk of lung injury, known in medical terms as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Babies with BPD have a higher chance of dying, and survivors with BPD have worse outcomes (such as poor lung condition, more frequent hospital readmissions, and worse childhood development) later in life than babies who do not have BPD. One of the causes of BPD is inflammation of the lungs. Inflammation is a common response of the body to injury. How is BPD treated? Corticosteroids are drugs that can work against inflammation (help to calm down the baby's immune response and reduce swelling) and are given to preterm babies to prevent or treat BPD. However, corticosteroids can also have serious unwanted effects (such as bowel perforation (hole in the digestive tract) and worse childhood development). Examples of corticosteroids used in preterm babies are dexamethasone and hydrocortisone. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which types of treatment with corticosteroids work best in babies born too early who are at risk of getting BPD. We also wanted to know if the treatments have unwanted side effects. What did we do? We looked for systematic reviews that included preterm babies at risk of BPD who were treated with corticosteroids. Systematic reviews summarise all the studies on a particular subject. We sorted the different treatments into the following four categories. • Effective treatment: more or larger positive effects than negative effects. • Promising treatment: positive effects, but we are not sure enough yet to use this treatment in everyone. Such treatments need to be studied more. • Ineffective or possibly unsafe treatment: the treatment is not working or has more or larger negative effects than positive effects. • No conclusions are possible: we don’t know enough about this treatment. What did we find? We found nine systematic reviews summarising 88 studies. The studies used various types of treatment with corticosteroids in 9419 preterm babies. Treatments differed in the following ways: type of corticosteroid, age of the baby at the start of treatment, amount of drug given, and the way the drug was given. Main results Effective treatment Treatment with dexamethasone  after the first week of life  may increase babies' survival, decrease BPD, and seems to be safe in babies at high risk of BPD. Promising treatment Giving corticosteroids directly into the windpipe, together with surfactant (a substance that allows the lungs to remain open after each breath, which is commonly used in preterm babies with breathing problems in the first few days after birth), likely results in a positive effect but has not been examined enough yet. This might be a promising treatment in the future. Ineffective or possibly unsafe treatment Treatment with dexamethasone  in the first week of life  likely results in a higher chance of surviving without BPD, but has serious unwanted effects (such as bowel perforation and development of spasticity (stiff or rigid muscles)). Treatment with hydrocortisone  in the first week of life  may result in a higher chance of surviving without BPD, but also has too many serious side effects to be used. Treatment with hydrocortisone  after the first week of life  likely has no effect on survival or BPD. No conclusions possible There is not enough information to know if treating with corticosteroids through inhaling is effective or might be better than infusion or by feeding tube. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have low to moderate confidence in the results of the studies included in the reviews. This is because the types of babies included and the treatments given differed across studies. Also, many of the studies were very small with few participants. As a result, we are uncertain about the best way to use corticosteroids for the prevention or treatment of BPD. How up‐to‐date is this evidence?

Appropriate pain and sedation management in ventilated preterm infants may decrease the risk of GMH‐IVH; however, it might be associated with harms. Objectives To summarize the evidence from systematic reviews regarding the effects and safety of pharmacological interventions related to pain and sedation management in order to prevent GMH‐IVH in ventilated preterm infants. Methods We searched the Cochrane Library August 2022 for reviews on pharmacological interventions for pain and sedation management to prevent GMH‐IVH in ventilated preterm infants (< 37 weeks' gestation). We included Cochrane Reviews assessing the following interventions administered within the first week of life: benzodiazepines, paracetamol, opioids, ibuprofen, anesthetics, barbiturates, and antiadrenergics. Primary outcomes were any GMH‐IVH (aGMH‐IVH), severe IVH (sIVH), all‐cause neonatal death (ACND), and major neurodevelopmental disability (MND). We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews using the AMSTAR‐2 tool. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results We included seven Cochrane Reviews and one Cochrane Review protocol. The reviews on clonidine and paracetamol did not include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) matching our inclusion criteria. We included 40 RCTs (3791 infants) from reviews on paracetamol for patent ductus arteriosus (3), midazolam (3), phenobarbital (9), opioids (20), and ibuprofen (5). The quality of the included reviews was high. The certainty of the evidence was moderate to very low, because of serious imprecision and study limitations. Germinal matrix hemorrhage‐intraventricular hemorrhage (any grade) Compared to placebo or no intervention, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of paracetamol on aGMH‐IVH (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 2.07; 2 RCTs, 82 infants; very low‐certainty evidence); midazolam may result in little to no difference in the incidence of aGMH‐IVH (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.24; 3 RCTs, 122 infants; low‐certainty evidence); the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of phenobarbital on aGMH‐IVH (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; 9 RCTs, 732 infants; very low‐certainty evidence); opioids may result in little to no difference in aGMH‐IVH (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; 7 RCTs, 469 infants; low‐certainty evidence); ibuprofen likely results in little to no difference in aGMH‐IVH (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21; 4 RCTs, 759 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Compared to ibuprofen, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of paracetamol on aGMH‐IVH (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.34; 1 RCT, 30 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Compared to midazolam, morphine may result in a reduction in aGMH‐IVH (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87; 1 RCT, 46 infants; low‐certainty evidence). Compared to diamorphine, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of morphine on aGMH‐IVH (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.07; 1 RCT, 88 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grade 3 to 4) Compared to placebo or no intervention, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of paracetamol on sIVH (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.43 to 7.49; 2 RCTs, 82 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and of phenobarbital (grade 3 to 4) (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.25; 9 RCTs, 732 infants; very low‐certainty evidence); opioids may result in little to no difference in sIVH (grade 3 to 4) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.34; 6 RCTs, 1299 infants; low‐certainty evidence); ibuprofen may result in little to no difference in sIVH (grade 3 to 4) (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.26; 4 RCTs, 747 infants; low‐certainty evidence). No studies on midazolam reported this outcome. Compared to ibuprofen, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of paracetamol on sIVH (RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.12 to 60.21; 1 RCT, 30 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Compared to midazolam, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of morphine on sIVH (grade 3 to 4) (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.43; 1 RCT, 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Compared to fentanyl, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of morphine on sIVH (grade 3 to 4) (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.95; 1 RCT, 163 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). All‐cause neonatal death Compared to placebo or no intervention, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of phenobarbital on ACND (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.72; 3 RCTs, 203 infants; very low‐certainty evidence); opioids likely result in little to no difference in ACND (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; 5 RCTs, 1189 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence); the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen on ACND (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.64; 2 RCTs, 112 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Compared to midazolam, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of morphine on ACND (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.16; 1 RCT, 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Compared to diamorphine, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of morphine on ACND (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.19; 1 RCT, 88 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Major neurodevelopmental disability Compared to placebo, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on MND at 18 to 24 months (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 10.29; 1 RCT, 78 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and at five to six years (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.56 to 4.56; 1 RCT, 95 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies on other drugs reported this outcome. Authors' conclusions None of the reported studies had an impact on aGMH‐IVH, sIVH, ACND, or MND. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Large RCTs of rigorous methodology are needed to achieve an optimal information size to assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for pain and sedation management for the prevention of GMH‐IVH and mortality in preterm infants. Studies might compare interventions against either placebo or other drugs. Reporting of the outcome data should include the assessment of GMH‐IVH and long‐term neurodevelopment. Plain language summary Medicines to manage pain and discomfort in premature babies assisted with breathing machines and at risk of brain bleeding Overview question Do pain medicines reduce brain bleeding and death and improve long‐term development in babies born too early ('preterm' babies) who need mechanical breathing assistance? Background Preterm babies, especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy are completed, sometimes develop brain bleeding. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or have only mild problems later in life. Babies with more serious bleeding may die or have problems later in life. Currently, there are no approaches to prevent or treat brain bleeding. What did we do? We searched for Cochrane Reviews that investigated pain medicines for preventing brain bleeding in preterm babies. We assessed the quality of the reviews and summarized their results, thus bringing all the current relevant evidence about these treatments into one place. What did we find? We included seven Cochrane Reviews and one protocol (plan) for a Cochrane Review. Two reviews included studies outside our area of interest; for example, they focused on babies born normally at the end of the pregnancy, or babies not needing breathing machines. The other five reviews investigated these medicines: paracetamol (3 studies), midazolam (3 studies), phenobarbital (9 studies), opioids (20 studies), and ibuprofen (5 studies). Main results • Less severe brain bleeding We are moderately confident in the evidence for ibuprofen, which likely results in no important difference in the amount of brain bleeding compared to placebo (an inactive or 'dummy' medicine) (ranging from 19% reduction to 21% increase). We are not confident in the evidence for: morphine compared to diamorphine; other medicines compared to placebo. None of the studies investigating other comparisons between two different medicines looked at this outcome. • Severe brain bleeding We are not confident in the evidence for paracetamol, phenobarbital, opioids, and ibuprofen compared to placebo. Similarly, we are not confident in the evidence for: paracetamol compared to ibuprofen; morphine compared to midazolam and fentanyl. No studies on midazolam compared to placebo and morphine to diamorphine reported severe brain bleeding. • Deaths (from any cause) at 28 days of life We are moderately confident in the evidence for opioids, which likely results in no important difference compared to placebo (ranging from 20% reduction to 55% increase). We are not confident in the evidence for: phenobarbital and ibuprofen compared to placebo; morphine compared to midazolam and diamorphine. No studies on paracetamol and midazolam compared to placebo, paracetamol to ibuprofen, and morphine to fentanyl reported deaths (from any cause) at 28 days of life. • Long‐term development We are not confident in the evidence for opioids compared to placebo on babies' long‐term development at 18 to 24 months old and at five to six years old. None of the other studies looked at long‐term development. We identified one Cochrane Review protocol on dexmedetomidine, a medicine to manage pain and help babies relax. We plan to include evidence from this review when it is published. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence for ibuprofen on less severe brain bleeding and opioids on deaths (from any cause) compared to placebo. We are not confident in the evidence for the other comparisons and outcomes. The studies either did not report information that we could use or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to August 2022.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Ibuprofen [therapeutic use]; *Perinatal Death; Acetaminophen [therapeutic use]; Analgesics, Opioid [adverse effects]; Cerebral Hemorrhage [chemically induced, prevention & control]; Female; Heroin; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Midazolam [adverse effects]; Pain [drug therapy]; Phenobarbital [therapeutic use]; Respiration, Artificial [adverse effects]; Systematic Reviews as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012706.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012706.pub2","Neonatal"

It is characterised by persisting pain that is disproportionate in magnitude or duration to the typical course of pain after similar injury. There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal management of CRPS, although a broad range of interventions have been described and are commonly used. This is the first update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2013. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane and non‐Cochrane systematic reviews of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of any intervention used to reduce pain, disability, or both, in adults with CRPS. Methods We identified Cochrane reviews and non‐Cochrane reviews through a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, PEDro, LILACS and Epistemonikos from inception to October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that included adults (≥18 years) diagnosed with CRPS, using any diagnostic criteria.  Two overview authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews and certainty of the evidence using the AMSTAR 2 and GRADE tools respectively. We extracted data for the primary outcomes pain, disability and adverse events, and the secondary outcomes quality of life, emotional well‐being, and participants' ratings of satisfaction or improvement with treatment.  Main results We included six Cochrane and 13 non‐Cochrane systematic reviews in the previous version of this overview and five Cochrane and 12 non‐Cochrane reviews in the current version. Using the AMSTAR 2 tool, we judged Cochrane reviews to have higher methodological quality than non‐Cochrane reviews. The studies in the included reviews were typically small and mostly at high risk of bias or of low methodological quality. We found no high‐certainty evidence for any comparison.  There was low‐certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may reduce pain intensity post‐intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.8 to −3.4, P = 0.001; I 2  = 81%; 4 trials, n = 181) and moderate‐certainty evidence that they are probably associated with increased adverse events of any nature (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.47; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 168.0; 4 trials, n = 181).  There was moderate‐certainty evidence that lidocaine local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade probably does not reduce pain intensity compared with placebo, and low‐certainty evidence that it may not reduce pain intensity compared with ultrasound of the stellate ganglion. No effect size was reported for either comparison. There was low‐certainty evidence that topical dimethyl sulfoxide may not reduce pain intensity compared with oral N‐acetylcysteine, but no effect size was reported. There was low‐certainty evidence that continuous bupivacaine brachial plexus block may reduce pain intensity compared with continuous bupivacaine stellate ganglion block, but no effect size was reported. For a wide range of other commonly used interventions, the certainty in the evidence was very low and provides insufficient evidence to either support or refute their use. Comparisons with low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence should be treated with substantial caution. We did not identify any RCT evidence for routinely used pharmacological interventions for CRPS such as tricyclic antidepressants or opioids. Authors' conclusions Despite a considerable increase in included evidence compared with the previous version of this overview, we identified no high‐certainty evidence for the effectiveness of any therapy for CRPS. Until larger, high‐quality trials are undertaken, formulating an evidence‐based approach to managing CRPS will remain difficult. Current non‐Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions for CRPS are of low methodological quality and should not be relied upon to provide an accurate and comprehensive summary of the evidence. Plain language summary Which treatments are effective for the management of complex regional pain syndrome in adults? Key messages There is a critical lack of high‐quality evidence for the benefits and risks of most treatments for adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Larger, well‐designed studies and higher‐quality reviews are needed to provide accurate evidence for benefits and risks of treatments for adults with CRPS.   What is complex regional pain syndrome? CRPS is a disabling chronic pain condition. People with CRPS experience persistent pain, usually in the hands or feet, that is not proportionate in severity to any underlying injury. It often involves a variety of other symptoms in the affected body part such as swelling, discolouration, stiffness, weakness, and changes to skin quality.    What did we want to find out? A broad range of therapies are used to treat CRPS. The effects of these therapies are summarised across a number of Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews. Our aim was to combine the information from these reviews into one accessible document. We specifically wanted to find out which treatments are effective in reducing pain and disability in adults with CRPS. We also wanted to find out whether these treatments cause any unwanted effects.   What did we do? We searched for Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews in the medical literature using online databases, from their beginning to October 2011, in the previous version of this overview, and between October 2011 and October 2022 in the current version. We included reviews that evaluated any treatment aiming to reduce pain intensity and disability in adults with CRPS. We judged the quality of the included reviews and summarised their results. We also rated our confidence in the evidence included in the reviews, based on factors such as study methods and size.   What did we find? We included six Cochrane and 13 non‐Cochrane systematic reviews in the previous version of this overview and five Cochrane and 12 non‐Cochrane reviews in the current version. These reviews included evidence relating to a large range of treatments, including drugs, surgical procedures, rehabilitation, and complementary and alternative therapies. For most treatments, there were only a small number of published studies and the quality of these studies was low. The review evidence suggests the following:      •   Compared with placebo (or 'dummy') treatment, bisphosphonates (a class of medicines that slow down bone loss) may reduce pain intensity shortly after treatment, but they are probably associated with some side effects.    •   Compared with a placebo (or sham) treatment, blocking the branches of the sympathetic nervous system with an anaesthetic probably does not reduce pain intensity.    •   There may not be any differences in the pain‐reducing effects of a topical cream called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and an amino acid supplement called N‐acetyl cysteine, but it is unclear whether either treatment works at all.    •   One type of nerve block, called a brachial plexus block, may reduce pain intensity more than another type of block, called a bupivacaine stellate ganglion block. For the majority of the commonly used drug, surgical, rehabilitation, and complementary and alternative therapies for CRPS, we found only very low‐quality evidence or no evidence at all. As a result, we cannot be certain about their effects on pain and disability in CRPS.     What are the limitations of the evidence? All of the included non‐Cochrane reviews were conducted in a way that affects the reliability of their findings. The studies included within both the Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews had several limitations, particularly due to the small number of included participants. The results presented within this overview demonstrate unclear benefits and risks for most treatments for adults with CRPS.   How up‐to‐date is this evidence? This overview updates our previous overview.

"CD013737.PUB2","Lewis, SR; Pritchard, MW; Estcourt, LJ; Stanworth, SJ; Griffin, XL","Interventions for reducing red blood cell transfusion in adults undergoing hip fracture surgery: an overview of systematic reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Following hip fracture, people sustain an acute blood loss caused by the injury and subsequent surgery. Because the majority of hip fractures occur in older adults, blood loss may be compounded by pre‐existing anaemia. Allogenic blood transfusions (ABT) may be given before, during, and after surgery to correct chronic anaemia or acute blood loss. However, there is uncertainty about the benefit‐risk ratio for ABT. This is a potentially scarce resource, with availability of blood products sometimes uncertain. Other strategies from Patient Blood Management may prevent or minimise blood loss and avoid administration of ABT. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews and other systematic reviews of randomised or quasi‐randomised trials evaluating the effects of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions, administered perioperatively, on reducing blood loss, anaemia, and the need for ABT in adults undergoing hip fracture surgery. Methods In January 2022, we searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases for systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions given to prevent or minimise blood loss, treat the effects of anaemia, and reduce the need for ABT, in adults undergoing hip fracture surgery. We searched for pharmacological interventions (fibrinogen, factor VIIa and factor XIII, desmopressin, antifibrinolytics, fibrin and non‐fibrin sealants and glue, agents to reverse the effects of anticoagulants, erythropoiesis agents, iron, vitamin B12, and folate replacement therapy) and non‐pharmacological interventions (surgical approaches to reduce or manage blood loss, intraoperative cell salvage and autologous blood transfusion, temperature management, and oxygen therapy). We used Cochrane methodology, and assessed the methodological quality of included reviews using AMSTAR 2. We assessed the degree of overlap of RCTs between reviews. Because overlap was very high, we used a hierarchical approach to select reviews from which to report data; we compared the findings of selected reviews with findings from the other reviews. Outcomes were: number of people requiring ABT, volume of transfused blood (measured as units of packed red blood cells (PRC)), postoperative delirium, adverse events, activities of daily living (ADL), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), and mortality. Main results We found 26 systematic reviews including 36 RCTs (3923 participants), which only evaluated tranexamic acid and iron. We found no reviews of other pharmacological interventions or any non‐pharmacological interventions. Tranexamic acid (17 reviews, 29 eligible RCTs) We selected reviews with the most recent search date, and which included data for the most outcomes. The methodological quality of these reviews was low. However, the findings were largely consistent across reviews. One review included 24 RCTs, with participants who had internal fixation or arthroplasty for different types of hip fracture. Tranexamic acid was given intravenously or topically during the perioperative period. In this review, based on a control group risk of 451 people per 1000, 194 fewer people per 1000 probably require ABT after receiving tranexamic acid (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.68; 21 studies, 2148 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty for possible publication bias. Review authors found that there was probably little or no difference in the risks of adverse events, reported as deep vein thrombosis (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.81; 22 studies), pulmonary embolism (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.86; 9 studies), myocardial infarction (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.33; 8 studies), cerebrovascular accident (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.70; 8 studies), or death (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.46; 10 studies). We judged evidence from these outcomes to be moderate certainty, downgraded for imprecision. Another review, with a similarly broad inclusion criteria, included 10 studies, and found that tranexamic acid probably reduces the volume of transfused PRC (0.53 fewer units, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.80; 7 studies, 813 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty because of unexplained high levels of statistical heterogeneity. No reviews reported outcomes of postoperative delirium, ADL, or HRQoL. Iron (9 reviews, 7 eligible RCTs) Whilst all reviews included studies in hip fracture populations, most also included other surgical populations. The most current, direct evidence was reported in two RCTs, with 403 participants with hip fracture; iron was given intravenously, starting preoperatively. This review did not include evidence for iron with erythropoietin. The methodological quality of this review was low. In this review, there was low‐certainty evidence from two studies (403 participants) that there may be little or no difference according to whether intravenous iron was given in: the number of people who required ABT (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.11), the volume of transfused blood (MD ‐0.07 units of PRC, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.17), infection (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.80), or mortality within 30 days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13). There may be little or no difference in delirium (25 events in the iron group compared to 26 events in control group; 1 study, 303 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are very unsure whether there was any difference in HRQoL, since it was reported without an effect estimate. The findings were largely consistent across reviews. We downgraded the evidence for imprecision, because studies included few participants, and the wide CIs indicated possible benefit and harm. No reviews reported outcomes of cognitive dysfunction, ADL, or HRQoL. Authors' conclusions Tranexamic acid probably reduces the need for ABT in adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, and there is probably little or no difference in adverse events. For iron, there may be little or no difference in overall clinical effects, but this finding is limited by evidence from only a few small studies. Reviews of these treatments did not adequately include patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMS), and evidence for their effectiveness remains incomplete. We were unable to effectively explore the impact of timing and route of administration between reviews. A lack of systematic reviews for other types of pharmacological or any non‐pharmacological interventions to reduce the need for ABT indicates a need for further evidence syntheses to explore this. Methodologically sound evidence syntheses should include PROMS within four months of surgery. Plain language summary What treatments reduce the need for a blood transfusion in adults who have broken their hip? Key messages ‐ Using a medicine called tranexamic acid before, during, or after surgery for a broken hip probably reduces the need for a blood transfusion. ‐ Treatment with iron may make little to no difference to whether people need a blood transfusion after they have broken their hip. What is the condition? A broken hip (a break at the top of the leg bone) is common in older adults whose bones may have weakened because of a condition called osteoporosis. People can lose large amounts of blood with this injury, and they will also lose blood while the bone is fixed in an operation. Many of these older people also have anaemia, with fewer red blood cells to help carry oxygen around the body. Often people will need to be given a blood transfusion (donated from another person) as part of their treatment. There are some risks with this, such as infections, a longer stay in hospital, or becoming confused after surgery. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out whether there were any treatments that could reduce the need for a blood transfusion. We were interested in any medicine, or any other method that reduces additional blood loss. We also wanted to know if these treatments improved people's quality of life after surgery, or caused any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for systematic reviews that looked at treatments to reduce blood loss in people with a broken hip. These reviews collect all the available evidence for a treatment from published studies and analyse their results. In this overview, we summarised the results of reviews and rated our confidence in the evidence that they reported. We based our judgements about our confidence on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 17 reviews about tranexamic acid and nine reviews about iron, which included 36 studies with 3923 participants. These reviews included many of the same studies; we summarised evidence from three reviews that provided the most relevant information. For tranexamic acid, one review included 24 studies with 2148 people with a broken hip, and another included 10 studies with 1123 people. In these studies, people were given tranexamic acid before, during, or after surgery (or at all three times); it was given either directly into a person's vein, or applied onto open wounds. For iron, one review included two studies with 403 people. The treatment was given directly into a vein either before surgery, or before and after surgery. We found no reviews for any other types of treatment. Main results Compared to no treatment (or a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain a medicine), tranexamic acid: ‐ probably reduces the need for a blood transfusion. For every 1000 people who have a hip fracture, 257 people might need a blood transfusion after receiving tranexamic acid, compared to 451 people who did not receive it; ‐ probably reduces the amount of transfused blood that a person is given; ‐ probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who have side effects from treatment (such as blood clots that develop in a deep vein), or the number of people who die within a month of breaking their hip. Compared to no treatment (or a 'dummy' treatment), iron may make little to no difference to: ‐ the number of people who need to have a blood transfusion; ‐ the amount of transfused blood, confusion after surgery, infections, or deaths within one month. We were not sure if receiving iron would affect people's health‐related quality of life four months after surgery. No reviews reported whether these treatments affected people's ability to carry out daily activities four months after surgery. No reviews about tranexamic acid reported information about confusion or health‐related quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are only moderately confident in the evidence that tranexamic acid reduces the need for blood transfusion. The studies that provided results in our selected review may not represent all of the evidence, and this may have exaggerated the benefits of this treatment. For other outcomes, some studies were too small, reported wide differences in their results, and we could not be certain if all the studies were well‐designed to give a reliable result. We have little confidence in our findings for iron treatment, because the studies were too small to produce reliable results. There were some flaws in the way all of the reviews came to their final conclusions, meaning that they may not have been conducted to the highest possible standard. However, the results in each review were all similar, and this meant that we were more confident that their results were accurately collected from study reports. How up to date is this evidence?

Several non‐pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches have been explored to prevent or treat a PDA. Objectives To summarise Cochrane Neonatal evidence on interventions (pharmacological or surgical) for the prevention of PDA and related complications, and interventions for the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic PDA in preterm infants. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 20 October 2022 for ongoing and published Cochrane Reviews on the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) or low birthweight (< 2500 g) infants. We included all published Cochrane Reviews assessing the following categories of interventions: pharmacological therapy using prostaglandin inhibitor drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen), adjunctive pharmacological interventions, invasive PDA closure procedures, and non‐pharmacological interventions. Two overview authors independently checked the eligibility of the reviews retrieved by the search, and extracted data from the included reviews using a predefined data extraction form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third overview author. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) tool. We reported the GRADE certainty of evidence as assessed by the respective review authors using summary of findings tables. Main results We included 16 Cochrane Reviews, corresponding to 138 randomised clinical trials (RCT) and 11,856 preterm infants, on the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm infants. One of the 16 reviews had no included studies, and therefore, did not contribute to the results. Six reviews reported on prophylactic interventions for the prevention of PDA and included pharmacological prophylaxis with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs, prophylactic surgical PDA ligation, and non‐pharmacologic interventions (chest shielding during phototherapy and restriction of fluid intake); one review reported on the use of indomethacin for the management of asymptomatic PDA; nine reviews reported on interventions for the management of symptomatic PDA, and included pharmacotherapy with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs in various routes and dosages, surgical PDA ligation, and adjunct therapies (use of furosemide and dopamine in conjunction with indomethacin). The quality of reviews varied. Two reviews were assessed to be high quality, seven reviews were of moderate quality, five of low quality, while two reviews were deemed to be of critically low quality. For prevention of PDA, prophylactic indomethacin reduces severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH; relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.82; 14 RCTs, 2588 infants), and the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 8 RCTs, 1791 infants), but it does not appear to affect the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15; 3 RCTs, 1491 infants). Prophylactic ibuprofen probably marginally reduces severe IVH (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; 7 RCTs, 925 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; 7 RCTs, 925 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.39; 1 RCT, 48 infants). Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) was lower with both prophylactic surgical ligation (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83; 1 RCT, 84 infants), and fluid restriction (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.87; 4 RCTs, 526 infants). For treatment of asymptomatic PDA, indomethacin appears to reduce the development of symptomatic PDA post‐treatment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.68; 3 RCTs, 97 infants; quality of source review: critically low). For treatment of symptomatic PDA, all available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs appear to be more effective in closing a PDA than placebo or no treatment (indomethacin: RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.38; 10 RCTs, 654 infants; high‐certainty evidence; ibuprofen: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.86; 2 RCTs, 206 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence; early administration of acetaminophen: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53; 2 RCTs, 127 infants; low‐certainty evidence). Oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than intravenous (IV) ibuprofen (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56; 5 RCTs, 406 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). High‐dose ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than standard‐dose ibuprofen (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61; 3 RCTs, 190 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). With respect to adverse outcomes, compared to indomethacin administration, NEC appears to be lower with ibuprofen (any route; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; 18 RCTs, 1292 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence), oral ibuprofen (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.73; 7 RCTs, 249 infants; low‐certainty evidence), and with acetaminophen (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96; 4 RCTs, 384 infants; low‐certainty evidence). However, NEC appears to be increased with a prolonged course of indomethacin versus a shorter course (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.27; 4 RCTs, 310 infants). Authors' conclusions This overview summarised the evidence from 16 Cochrane Reviews of RCTs regarding the effects of interventions for the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm infants. Prophylactic indomethacin reduces severe IVH, but does not appear to affect the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably marginally reduces severe IVH (moderate‐certainty evidence), while the evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH. All available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs appear to be effective in symptomatic PDA closure compared to no treatment (high‐certainty evidence for indomethacin; moderate‐certainty evidence for ibuprofen; low‐certainty evidence for early administration of acetaminophen). Oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than IV ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence). High dose ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than standard‐dose ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence). There are currently two ongoing reviews, one on fluid restriction for symptomatic PDA, and the other on invasive management of PDA in preterm infants. Plain language summary Treatments to manage patent ductus arteriosus in premature babies Review question What treatments are effective and safe in preventing or treating a common heart condition, called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature babies? Background PDA is a common complication among premature and low birthweight babies. PDA is an open blood vessel channel between the lungs and the heart, which usually closes shortly after birth. In premature and low birthweight babies, the PDA may remain open, and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. We wanted to see what treatments can safely and effectively prevent or treat a PDA and its related problems. Study characteristics We included 16 Cochrane Reviews. Out of them, six reviews provided evidence on preventing a PDA with drugs, surgery, or other means that do not involve drugs or surgery. One review provided evidence of treating a PDA before the babies experience symptoms, while the rest of the reviews provided evidence on treating babies who are experiencing symptoms from their PDA, with either drugs or surgery. Key Results This overview found that both indomethacin and ibuprofen may reduce severe brain bleeding and the need for PDA surgery, when given to premature babies before they experienced symptoms from a PDA. When babies are experiencing symptoms from a PDA, all available drug therapies, that is, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen (specifically when given early) are effective in closing a PDA. If using ibuprofen therapy, giving the medication by mouth appears to be better than giving it by intravenous route; and higher doses of ibuprofen appears to be more effective in closing a PDA than standard doses. Certainty of the evidence According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to high. According to the AMSTAR 2 criteria (a method to rate the quality of reviews), the quality of the included Cochrane Reviews also varied from high to critically low, but were mostly between moderate and low.

Methods The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched from inception to 3 June 2021, to identify reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated systemic pharmacological interventions for adults with non‐specific LBP. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews and certainty of the evidence using the AMSTAR 2 and GRADE tools. The review focused on placebo comparisons and the main outcomes were pain intensity, function, and safety. Main results Seven Cochrane Reviews that included 103 studies (22,238 participants) were included. There is high confidence in the findings of five reviews, moderate confidence in one, and low confidence in the findings of another. The reviews reported data on six medicines or medicine classes: paracetamol, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, opioids, and antidepressants. Three reviews included participants with acute or sub‐acute LBP and five reviews included participants with chronic LBP. Acute LBP Paracetamol There was high‐certainty evidence for no evidence of difference between paracetamol and placebo for reducing pain intensity (MD 0.49 on a 0 to 100 scale (higher scores indicate worse pain), 95% CI ‐1.99 to 2.97), reducing disability (MD 0.05 on a 0 to 24 scale (higher scores indicate worse disability), 95% CI ‐0.50 to 0.60), and increasing the risk of adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33). NSAIDs There was moderate‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring NSAIDs compared to placebo at reducing pain intensity (MD ‐7.29 on a 0 to 100 scale (higher scores indicate worse pain), 95% CI ‐10.98 to ‐3.61), high‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference for reducing disability (MD ‐2.02 on a 0‐24 scale (higher scores indicate worse disability), 95% CI ‐2.89 to ‐1.15), and very low‐certainty evidence for no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0. 63 to 1.18). Muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines There was moderate‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring muscle relaxants compared to placebo for a higher chance of pain relief (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.76), and higher chance of improving physical function (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77), and increased risk of adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1. 14 to 1.98). Opioids None of the included Cochrane Reviews aimed to identify evidence for acute LBP. Antidepressants No evidence was identified by the included reviews for acute LBP. Chronic LBP Paracetamol No evidence was identified by the included reviews for chronic LBP. NSAIDs There was low‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring NSAIDs compared to placebo for reducing pain intensity (MD ‐6.97 on a 0 to 100 scale (higher scores indicate worse pain), 95% CI ‐10.74 to ‐3.19), reducing disability (MD ‐0.85 on a 0‐24 scale (higher scores indicate worse disability), 95% CI ‐1.30 to ‐0.40), and no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI ‐0.92 to 1.17), all at intermediate‐term follow‐up (> 3 months and ≤ 12 months postintervention). Muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines There was low‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring benzodiazepines compared to placebo for a higher chance of pain relief (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93), and low‐certainty evidence for no evidence of difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.57). Opioids There was high‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring tapentadol compared to placebo at reducing pain intensity (MD ‐8.00 on a 0 to 100 scale (higher scores indicate worse pain), 95% CI ‐1.22 to ‐0.38), moderate‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring strong opioids for reducing pain intensity (SMD ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.52 to ‐0.33), low‐certainty evidence for a medium between‐group difference favouring tramadol for reducing pain intensity (SMD ‐0.55, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.44) and very low‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring buprenorphine for reducing pain intensity (SMD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐0.57 to ‐0.26). There was moderate‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring strong opioids compared to placebo for reducing disability (SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.15), moderate‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring tramadol for reducing disability (SMD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.07), and low‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference favouring buprenorphine for reducing disability (SMD ‐0.14, 95% CI ‐0.53 to ‐0.25). There was low‐certainty evidence for a small between‐group difference for an increased risk of adverse events for opioids (all types) compared to placebo; nausea (RD 0.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.14), headaches (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05), constipation (RD 0.07, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.11), and dizziness (RD 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11). Antidepressants There was low‐certainty evidence for no evidence of difference for antidepressants (all types) compared to placebo for reducing pain intensity (SMD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.25 to 0.17) and reducing disability (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 0.29). Authors' conclusions We found no high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence that any investigated pharmacological intervention provided a large or medium effect on pain intensity for acute or chronic LBP compared to placebo. For acute LBP, we found moderate‐certainty evidence that NSAIDs and muscle relaxants may provide a small effect on pain, and high‐certainty evidence for no evidence of difference between paracetamol and placebo. For safety, we found very low‐ and high‐certainty evidence for no evidence of difference with NSAIDs and paracetamol compared to placebo for the risk of adverse events, and moderate‐certainty evidence that muscle relaxants may increase the risk of adverse events. For chronic LBP, we found low‐certainty evidence that NSAIDs and very low‐ to high‐certainty evidence that opioids may provide a small effect on pain. For safety, we found low‐certainty evidence for no evidence of difference between NSAIDs and placebo for the risk of adverse events, and low‐certainty evidence that opioids may increase the risk of adverse events.  Plain language summary Pharmacological treatments for low back pain in adults: an overview of Cochrane Reviews Key messages For acute low back pain  • NSAIDs and muscle relaxants may provide small benefits on pain, however muscle relaxants may be associated with unwanted effects. Paracetamol had no effect on pain or unwanted effects. For chronic low back pain • Opioids may reduce pain but may be associated with unwanted effects. NSAIDs may reduce pain without unwanted effects and antidepressants may make little or no difference on pain.  •  Physicians should discuss the possibility for a small effect on pain and increased risk for unwanted effects when considering different medicines for treating low back pain. Funders and researchers should prioritise identification of medicines that provide clinically meaningful benefits to people with low back pain. What is low back pain and how is it treated? Low back pain (LBP) is a common and debilitating health condition. In most cases, the cause or causes of low back pain cannot be reliably identified and is described as ‘non‐specific’ LBP. Physicians commonly prescribe medicines to treat LBP. There are many types of medicines and medicine classes available, for example, opioid analgesics, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and paracetamol. With so many options available, there is a need to determine which medicines are best and safest. What did we want to find out? We wanted to summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the most effective and safest medicines for adults with non‐specific LBP. What did we do? We searched for all Cochrane systematic reviews that assessed the benefits and harms of medicines for adults with non‐specific LBP to produce an overview of Cochrane evidence. What did we find? We found seven reviews (that included 103 studies on a total of 22,238 people). Five reviews were assessed as having high quality. The included reviews reported data on six distinct medicines or medicine classes: paracetamol, NSAIDs (for example, ibruprofen), muscle relaxants (for example, cyclobenzaprine), benzodiazepines (for example, diazepam), opioids (for example, tapentadol), and antidepressants (for example, paroxetine). Five reviews included participants reporting LBP lasting longer than six weeks. The confidence in the evidence ranged from very low to high. For people with acute LBP, we found that NSAIDs and muscle relaxants may reduce pain in the short‐term (≤ three months postintervention). However, muscle relaxants may be associated with unwanted effects. Paracetamol had no effect on pain or unwanted effects and no reviews looked at opioids or antidepressants. For chronic LBP, we found that opioids may reduce pain in the short‐term but may be associated with unwanted effects such as nausea, headache, constipation, and dizziness. NSAIDs may reduce pain in the intermediate term (> 3 months and ≤ 12 months postintervention) without unwanted effects. Antidepressants had no effect on chronic LBP and no review looked at paracetamol for chronic LBP. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have reduced confidence in the evidence because one review was of moderate quality and one review was of low quality and six reviews were published more than five years ago. There is a need to update these Cochrane Reviews following recommended guidance. For acute LBP, we are at least moderately confident about the effects of paracetamol, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants on short‐term pain and function. For other time points and other medicines (e.g. opioids, antidepressants), we have no evidence to inform treatment decisions. For chronic LBP, we are at least moderately confident about the effects of paracetamol and opioids on short‐term pain and function but less confident about the effects of other medicines (e.g. NSAIDs, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and benzodiazepines). Factors that decreased confidence in findings included flaws in how the studies were designed (patients were not assigned to treatments randomly, allocation to treatment assignment was not concealed, patients were not compliant to their prescribed treatment), not having enough studies or participants to be certain about the results, and variations between treatment delivery. The definition and reporting of unwanted effects for each medicine within each review was limited, making it difficult to assess safety for each pharmacological intervention. There remains clear gaps in the evidence base for the safety of medicines for LBP.  How up to date is this evidence?

Chronic pain is typically described as pain on most days for at least three months. Chronic non‐cancer pain (CNCP) is any chronic pain that is not due to a malignancy. Chronic non‐cancer pain in adults is a common and complex clinical issue, for which opioids are prescribed by some physicians for pain management. There are concerns that the use of high doses of opioids for CNCP lacks evidence of effectiveness, and may increase the risk of adverse events. Objectives To describe the evidence from Cochrane Reviews and overviews regarding the efficacy and safety of high‐dose opioids (defined as 200 mg morphine equivalent or more per day) for CNCP. Methods We identified Cochrane Reviews and overviews by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in The Cochrane Library. The date of the last search was 21 July 2022. Two overview authors independently assessed the search results. We planned to analyse data on any opioid agent used at a high dose for two weeks or more for the treatment of CNCP in adults. Main results We did not identify any reviews or overviews that met the inclusion criteria. The excluded reviews largely reflected low doses or titrated doses, where all doses were analysed as a single group; we were unable to extract any data for high‐dose use only. Authors' conclusions There is a critical lack of high‐quality evidence, in the form of Cochrane Reviews, about how well high‐dose opioids work for the management of CNCP in adults, and regarding the presence and severity of adverse events.  No evidence‐based argument can be made on the use of high‐dose opioids, i.e. 200 mg morphine equivalent or more daily, in clinical practice. Considering that high‐dose opioids have been, and are still being used in clinical practice to treat CNCP, knowing about the efficacy and safety of these higher doses is imperative. Plain language summary High doses of opioid medicines for the management of chronic non‐cancer pain Bottom line There is no high‐quality evidence to show how well high doses of opioids work, or what side effects they cause, when they are used for adults with chronic pain that is not due to cancer.  Studies usually used doses below our cutoff. We need to know how well high‐dose opioid medicine works for chronic non‐cancer pain, and what side effects there may be. Background Opioids are a type of pain medicine related to morphine. Opioids have been used for many years as painkillers for moderate or severe chronic pain, which is pain that lasts for a long time (usually longer than three months). Study characteristics In this updated overview, we aimed to summarise the knowledge from Cochrane Reviews and overviews about opioid medicine for pain relief in adults who had chronic pain not due to cancer. We wanted to know how well opioid medicines worked when they were used at high doses (equal to 200 mg of morphine per day or more), and what side effects there might be. Key results Despite systematic searches, most recently conducted in July 2022, we did not find any information about this. Studies on opioids rarely reported on high‐dose use. When they included them as part of a study of people using all levels of doses, they did not report separate information for people who used high‐dose opioids.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Analgesics, Opioid [adverse effects]; *Chronic Pain [drug therapy]; Adult; Humans; Morphine [adverse effects]; Pain Management; Systematic Reviews as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012299.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012299.pub3","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

The common types of UI are stress (SUI), urgency (UUI) and mixed (MUI). A wide range of interventions can be delivered to reduce the symptoms of UI in women. Conservative interventions are generally recommended as the first line of treatment. Objectives To summarise Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effects of conservative interventions for treating UI in women. Methods We searched the Cochrane Library to January 2021 (CDSR; 2021, Issue 1) and included any Cochrane Review that included studies with women aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of SUI, UUI or MUI, and investigating a conservative intervention aimed at improving or curing UI. We included reviews that compared a conservative intervention with 'control' (which included placebo, no treatment or usual care), another conservative intervention or another active, but non‐conservative, intervention. A stakeholder group informed the selection and synthesis of evidence. Two overview authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data and judged review quality, resolving disagreements through discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were patient‐reported cure or improvement and condition‐specific quality of life. We judged the risk of bias in included reviews using the ROBIS tool. We judged the certainty of evidence within the reviews based on the GRADE approach. Evidence relating to SUI, UUI or all types of UI combined (AUI) were synthesised separately. The AUI group included evidence relating to participants with MUI, as well as from studies that combined women with different diagnoses (i.e. SUI, UUI and MUI) and studies in which the type of UI was unclear. Main results We included 29 relevant Cochrane Reviews. Seven focused on physical therapies; five on education, behavioural and lifestyle advice; one on mechanical devices; one on acupuncture and one on yoga. Fourteen focused on non‐conservative interventions but had a comparison with a conservative intervention. No reviews synthesised evidence relating to psychological therapies. There were 112 unique trials (including 8975 women) that had primary outcome data included in at least one analysis. Stress urinary incontinence (14 reviews) Conservative intervention versus control:  there was moderate or high certainty evidence that pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), PFMT plus biofeedback and cones were more beneficial than control for curing or improving UI. PFMT and intravaginal devices improved quality of life compared to control. One conservative intervention versus another conservative intervention:  for cure and improvement of UI, there was moderate or high certainty evidence that: continence pessary plus PFMT was more beneficial than continence pessary alone; PFMT plus educational intervention was more beneficial than cones; more‐intensive PFMT was more beneficial than less‐intensive PFMT; and PFMT plus an adherence strategy was more beneficial than PFMT alone. There was no moderate or high certainty evidence for quality of life. Urgency urinary incontinence (five reviews) Conservative intervention versus control:  there was moderate to high‐certainty evidence demonstrating that PFMT plus feedback, PFMT plus biofeedback, electrical stimulation and bladder training were more beneficial than control for curing or improving UI. Women using electrical stimulation plus PFMT had higher quality of life than women in the control group. One conservative intervention versus another conservative intervention:  for cure or improvement, there was moderate certainty evidence that electrical stimulation was more effective than laseropuncture. There was high or moderate certainty evidence that PFMT resulted in higher quality of life than electrical stimulation and electrical stimulation plus PFMT resulted in better cure or improvement and higher quality of life than PFMT alone. All types of urinary incontinence (13 reviews) Conservative intervention versus control:  there was moderate to high certainty evidence of better cure or improvement with PFMT, electrical stimulation, weight loss and cones compared to control. There was moderate certainty evidence of improved quality of life with PFMT compared to control. One conservative intervention versus another conservative intervention:  there was moderate or high certainty evidence of better cure or improvement for PFMT with bladder training than bladder training alone. Likewise, PFMT with more individual health professional supervision was more effective than less contact/supervision and more‐intensive PFMT was more beneficial than less‐intensive PFMT. There was moderate certainty evidence that PFMT plus bladder training resulted in higher quality of life than bladder training alone. Authors' conclusions There is high certainty that PFMT is more beneficial than control for all types of UI for outcomes of cure or improvement and quality of life. We are moderately certain that, if PFMT is more intense, more frequent, with individual supervision, with/without combined with behavioural interventions with/without an adherence strategy, effectiveness is improved. We are highly certain that, for cure or improvement, cones are more beneficial than control (but not PFMT) for women with SUI, electrical stimulation is beneficial for women with UUI, and weight loss results in more cure and improvement than control for women with AUI. Most evidence within the included Cochrane Reviews is of low certainty. It is important that future new and updated Cochrane Reviews develop questions that are more clinically useful, avoid multiple overlapping reviews and consult women with UI to further identify outcomes of importance. Plain language summary Conservative interventions for urinary incontinence in women: an overview of Cochrane Reviews What is urinary incontinence? Bladder problems are common in women. Having to go to the toilet frequently, urgently and sometimes not making it in time is called urgency urinary incontinence. Urgency urinary incontinence occurs when, for some reason, the signals telling women to empty their bladder are much stronger and occur more often than necessary. Leaking when sneezing or exercising is called stress urinary incontinence, and can happen if the muscles controlling the outlet from the bladder are weaker than they should be. Women can also have a mixture of these two conditions, which is called mixed urinary incontinence. Symptoms of bladder problems can cause a lot of distress. For example, women can often be reluctant to go out and may fear going for walks or taking part in exercise classes. Often these women can feel isolated and their quality of life is significantly poorer compared to women without bladder symptoms. How is urinary incontinence treated? Treatment options for urinary incontinence mainly include 'conservative treatment' (avoiding invasive methods), medication and surgery. Conservative treatments should be offered first and these include training of the pelvic floor muscle (muscle between the tail bone (coccyx) and pubic bone that support the bladder, bowel, vagina, and womb) (with and without add‐on treatments such as electrical stimulation), bladder training and devices. These are usually provided by physiotherapists or nurses who have had specialist training. What did we aim to do? There are a growing number of Cochrane Reviews relating to conservative management for different types of urinary incontinence, and our aim was to bring together these research findings into one accessible overview document, with input from clinicians and women affected by incontinence. How up‐to‐date is this overview? This overview is up‐to‐date to 18 January 2021. What did we do? We searched for Cochrane Reviews relating to the conservative management of urinary incontinence in women and found 29 relevant reviews. From these, we collated data regarding the type of intervention (treatment) and what it was compared to in tables. The comparison treatment could have been a control (such as a sham (pretend) treatment or usual care), another conservative intervention or a non‐conservative intervention. We identified two key outcomes that were important to women: if they were cured or improved and if their quality of life had improved. We assessed the quality of the included reviews and the certainty of the data within these reviews (the extent of our confidence that review results are correct in supporting or rejecting a finding). Key results There is high certainty evidence that undertaking pelvic floor muscle training can cure symptoms and improve quality of life for all types of urinary incontinence. There is moderate or high certainty evidence that these pelvic floor muscle exercises work better if they are more intense, have more support from a health professional, and are combined with strategies to support continued use. Lifestyle modifications, such as losing weight and trying to control how often you empty your bladder, may also be beneficial for some types of urinary incontinence. The use of adjuncts, such as electrical stimulation, may also be of benefit, especially for those with mixed or urgency urinary incontinence. Quality of evidence Approximately half of our findings provided moderate or high certainty evidence. However, 81% of our findings from analyses within the reviews included data only from one trial. These reviews had not been able to pull together the results of several trials. We could not identify any Cochrane Reviews for some commonly used treatments, such as psychological therapies. Generally, long‐term follow‐up was lacking and the use of multiple and diverse outcomes limited the possibility of combining results to give meaningful evidence. Authors' conclusions There is a lot of evidence for conservative management of urinary incontinence in women and the use of pelvic floor muscle exercises is strongly supported for most patients, regardless of the type of incontinence. However, there are many limitations with the current evidence for conservative treatment of urinary incontinence and often the evidence does not support clear clinical decisions. More research is urgently required to establish high‐quality evidence addressing questions which matter to women affected by urinary incontinence.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pelvic Floor; *Urinary Incontinence [therapy]; Exercise Therapy [methods]; Female; Humans; Quality of Life; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Weight Loss","10.1002/14651858.CD012337.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012337.pub2","Incontinence"

It is a very common condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 2 to 5 of every 10 women. Diverse treatments, either medical (hormonal or non‐hormonal) or surgical, are currently available for HMB, with different effectiveness, acceptability, costs and side effects. The best treatment will depend on the woman's age, her intention to become pregnant, the presence of other symptoms, and her personal views and preferences. Objectives To identify, systematically assess and summarise all evidence from studies included in Cochrane Reviews on treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), using reviews with comparable participants and outcomes; and to present a ranking of the first‐ and second‐line treatments for HMB. Methods We searched for published Cochrane Reviews of HMB interventions in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The primary outcomes were menstrual bleeding and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events and the requirement of further treatment. Two review authors independently selected the systematic reviews, extracted data and assessed quality, resolving disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool and evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We grouped the interventions into first‐ and second‐line treatments, considering participant characteristics (desire for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment, candidacy for surgery). First‐line treatments included medical interventions, and second‐line treatments included both the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) and surgical treatments; thus the LNG‐IUS is included in both groups. We developed different networks for first‐ and second‐line treatments. We performed network meta‐analyses of all outcomes, except for quality of life, where we performed pairwise meta‐analyses. We reported the mean rank, the network estimates for mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the certainty of evidence (moderate, low or very low certainty). We also analysed different endometrial ablation and resection techniques separately from the main network: transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) with or without rollerball, other resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA), microwave non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA), hydrothermal ablation NREA, bipolar NREA, balloon NREA and other NREA. Main results We included nine systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library up to July 2021. We updated the reviews that were over two years old. In July 2020, we started the overview with no new reviews about the topic. The included medical interventions were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included to provide indirect evidence), which were compared to placebo. Surgical interventions were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of route of) hysterectomy, REA, NREA, unspecified endometrial ablation (EA) and LNG‐IUS. We grouped the interventions as follows. First‐line treatments Evidence from 26 studies with 1770 participants suggests that LNG‐IUS results in a large reduction of menstrual blood loss (MBL; mean rank 2.4, MD −105.71 mL/cycle, 95% CI −201.10 to −10.33; low certainty evidence); antifibrinolytics probably reduce MBL (mean rank 3.7, MD −80.32 mL/cycle, 95% CI −127.67 to −32.98; moderate certainty evidence); long‐cycle progestogen reduces MBL (mean rank 4.1, MD −76.93 mL/cycle, 95% CI −153.82 to −0.05; low certainty evidence), and NSAIDs slightly reduce MBL (mean rank 6.4, MD −40.67 mL/cycle, −84.61 to 3.27; low certainty evidence; reference comparator mean rank 8.9). We are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions and the sensitivity analysis for reduction of MBL, as the evidence was rated as very low certainty. We are uncertain of the true effect of any intervention (very low certainty evidence) on the perception of improvement and satisfaction. Second‐line treatments Bleeding reduction is related to the type of hysterectomy (total or supracervical/subtotal), not the route, so we combined all routes of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes. We assessed the reduction of MBL without imputed data (11 trials, 1790 participants) and with imputed data (15 trials, 2241 participants). Evidence without imputed data suggests that hysterectomy (mean rank 1.2, OR 25.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 439.96; low certainty evidence) and REA (mean rank 2.8, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 5.66; low certainty evidence) result in a large reduction of MBL, and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.0, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.23; moderate certainty evidence). Evidence with imputed data suggests hysterectomy results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 1.0, OR 14.31, 95% CI 2.99 to 68.56; low certainty evidence), and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.2, OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.05; moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the true effect for REA (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea (very low certainty evidence). Evidence from 27 trials with 4284 participants suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction (mean rank 1.3, OR 7.96, 95% CI 3.33 to 19.03; low certainty evidence), and NREA also increases satisfaction (mean rank 3.6, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; low certainty evidence), but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions (very low certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Evidence suggests LNG‐IUS is the best first‐line treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL); antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are likely the third best. We cannot make conclusions about the effect of first‐line treatments on perception of improvement and satisfaction, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, followed by REA and NREA. We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. Minimally invasive hysterectomy may result in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA also increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining second‐line interventions, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. Plain language summary Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding? Key results Evidence suggests that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is the best first‐line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true effect of these first‐line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true effect of the second‐line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions. What is heavy menstrual bleeding? Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can affect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are different treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. What did we want to find out? We wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment affected quality of life, what side effects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. What did we do? This study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First‐line treatment included medical interventions and second‐line treatment included the LNG‐IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG‐IUS was included in both first‐ and second‐line treatments. We used network meta‐analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. What did we find? We found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were often not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. How up to date is this evidence? The last search for reviews was in July 2021.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Antifibrinolytic Agents [therapeutic use]; *Menorrhagia [drug therapy, surgery]; Amenorrhea; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Progestins [therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Systematic Reviews as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD013180.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013180.pub2","Gynaecology and Fertility"

It is caused by delayed clearance of lung fluid at birth. TTN typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Although it is usually a self‐limited condition, admission to a neonatal unit is frequently required for monitoring, the provision of respiratory support, and drugs administration. These interventions might reduce respiratory distress during TTN and enhance the clearance of lung liquid. The goals are reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress, and potentially shortening the duration of tachypnoea. However, these interventions might be associated with harm in the infant. Objectives The aim of this overview was to evaluate the benefits and harms of different interventions used in the management of TTN. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 14 July 2021 for ongoing and published Cochrane Reviews on the management of TTN in term (> 37 weeks' gestation) or late preterm (34 to 36 weeks' gestation) infants. We included all published Cochrane Reviews assessing the following categories of interventions administered within the first 48 hours of life: beta‐agonists (e.g. salbutamol and epinephrine), corticosteroids, diuretics, fluid restriction, and non‐invasive respiratory support. The reviews compared the above‐mentioned interventions to placebo, no treatment, or other interventions for the management of TTN. The primary outcomes of this overview were duration of tachypnoea and the need for mechanical ventilation. Two overview authors independently checked the eligibility of the reviews retrieved by the search and extracted data from the included reviews using a predefined data extraction form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third overview author. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) tool. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for effects of interventions for TTN management. As all of the included reviews reported summary of findings tables, we extracted the information already available and re‐graded the certainty of evidence of the two primary outcomes to ensure a homogeneous assessment. We provided a narrative summary of the methods and results of each of the included reviews and summarised this information using tables and figures. Main results  We included six Cochrane Reviews, corresponding to 1134 infants enrolled in 18 trials, on the management of TTN in term and late preterm infants, assessing salbutamol (seven trials), epinephrine (one trial), budesonide (one trial), diuretics (two trials), fluid restriction (four trials), and non‐invasive respiratory support (three trials). The quality of the included reviews was high, with all of them fulfilling the critical domains of the AMSTAR 2. The certainty of the evidence was very low for the primary outcomes, due to the imprecision of the estimates (few, small included studies) and unclear or high risk of bias. Salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnoea compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) −16.83 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) −22.42 to −11.23, 2 studies, 120 infants, low certainty evidence). We did not identify any review that compared epinephrine or corticosteroids to placebo and reported on the duration of tachypnoea. However, one review reported on ""trend of normalisation of respiratory rate"", a similar outcome, and found no differences between epinephrine and placebo (effect size not reported). The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of diuretics compared to placebo (MD −1.28 hours, 95% CI −13.0 to 10.45, 2 studies, 100 infants, very low certainty evidence). We did not identify any review that compared fluid restriction to standard fluid rates and reported on the duration of tachypnoea. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared to free‐flow oxygen therapy (MD −21.1 hours, 95% CI −22.9 to −19.3, 1 study, 64 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of nasal high‐frequency (oscillation) ventilation (NHFV) compared to CPAP (MD −4.53 hours, 95% CI −5.64 to −3.42, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence); and the effect of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) compared to CPAP on duration of tachypnoea (MD 4.30 hours, 95% CI −19.14 to 27.74, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence). Regarding the need for mechanical ventilation, the evidence is very uncertain for the effect of salbutamol compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.86, risk difference (RD) 10 fewer, 95% CI 50 fewer to 30 more per 1000, 3 studies, 254 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of epinephrine compared to placebo (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.88, RD 70 fewer, 95% CI 460 fewer to 320 more per 1000, 1 study, 20 infants, very low certainty evidence); and the effect of corticosteroids compared to placebo (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.38, RD 40 fewer, 95% CI 170 fewer to 90 more per 1000, 1 study, 49 infants, very low certainty evidence). We did not identify a review that compared diuretics to placebo and reported on the need for mechanical ventilation. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of fluid restriction compared to standard fluid administration (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.23, RD 20 fewer, 95% CI 70 fewer to 40 more per 1000, 3 studies, 242 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of CPAP compared to free‐flow oxygen (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.99, RD 30 fewer, 95% CI 120 fewer to 50 more per 1000, 1 study, 64 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of NIPPV compared to CPAP (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 32.72, RD 150 more, 95% CI 50 fewer to 350 more per 1000, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence); and the effect of NHFV versus CPAP (effect not estimable, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence). Regarding our secondary outcomes, duration of hospital stay was the only outcome reported in all of the included reviews. One trial on fluid restriction reported a lower duration of hospitalisation in the restricted‐fluids group, but with very low certainty of evidence. The evidence was very uncertain for the effects on secondary outcomes for the other five reviews. Data on potential harms were scarce, as all of the trials were underpowered to detect possible increases in adverse events such as pneumothorax, arrhythmias, and electrolyte imbalances. No adverse effects were reported for salbutamol; however, this medication is known to carry a risk of tachycardia, tremor, and hypokalaemia in other settings. Authors' conclusions This overview summarises the evidence from six Cochrane Reviews of randomised trials regarding the effects of postnatal interventions in the management of TTN. Salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnoea slightly. We are uncertain as to whether salbutamol reduces the need for mechanical ventilation. We are uncertain whether epinephrine, corticosteroids, diuretics, fluid restriction, or non‐invasive respiratory support reduces the duration of tachypnoea and the need for mechanical ventilation, due to the extremely limited evidence available. Data on harms were lacking. Plain language summary Treatments to manage rapid breathing in babies (transient tachypnoea of the newborn) Review question Do drugs and other treatments in babies with abnormally rapid breathing (known as transient tachypnoea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for breathing support (i.e. mechanical ventilation) and/or duration of symptoms? Background Transient tachypnoea of the newborn is characterised by rapid breathing (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in babies born at or after 34 weeks' of pregnancy. Although transient tachypnoea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood. This Cochrane overview reported and critically analysed the available evidence on the benefit and harms of different treatments for the management of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. Study characteristics We included six Cochrane Reviews. Four of them compared drugs (salbutamol, epinephrine, corticosteroid, and diuretics) with placebo, whilst the remaining two reviews assessed the effects of giving a lesser quantity of fluids and breathing (respiratory) support without insertion of a tube into the lungs. Salbutamol, epinephrine, and corticosteroids remove the excess fluid from the lungs, whereas a diuretic is a drug that promotes the secretion of lung fluid in the urine. The evidence is up‐to‐date as of July 2021. Results Due to the very limited available evidence, we could not answer the question of our overview. Salbutamol may reduce the duration of rapid breathing compared to placebo. The studies on epinephrine and corticosteroids did not provide information on this outcome. The evidence is very uncertain for the effect of diuretics compared to placebo. The studies on giving a lesser quantity of fluids did not provide information on this outcome. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of different types of respiratory support without the insertion of a tube into the lungs compared to oxygen or compared to each other on the duration of rapid breathing. We are uncertain about the effects of salbutamol, epinephrine, and corticosteroids in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation (use of a machine to help the patient breathe where a tube is inserted into the lungs). The studies on diuretics did not provide information on this outcome. We are uncertain about the effects of respiratory support without insertion of a tube into the lungs, and giving a lesser quantity of fluids in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation. Certainty of evidence The certainty of the evidence was low for salbutamol for duration of rapid breathing, and very low for all other outcomes and treatments. The studies either did not report information that we could use or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn [therapy]; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intermittent Positive-Pressure Ventilation; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Systematic Reviews as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD013563.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013563.pub2","Neonatal"

Some types are preventable or controllable with iron supplementation (pills or drops), fortification (sprinkles or powders containing iron added to food) or improvements to dietary diversity and quality (e.g. education or counselling). Objectives To summarise the evidence from systematic reviews regarding the benefits or harms of nutrition‐specific interventions for preventing and controlling anaemia in anaemic or non‐anaemic, apparently healthy populations throughout the life cycle. Methods In August 2020, we searched MEDLINE, Embase and 10 other databases for systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in anaemic or non‐anaemic, apparently healthy populations. We followed Cochrane methodology, extracting GRADE ratings where provided. The primary outcomes were haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, anaemia, and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA); secondary outcomes were iron deficiency (ID), severe anaemia and adverse effects (e.g. diarrhoea, vomiting). Main results We included 75 systematic reviews, 33 of which provided GRADE assessments; these varied between high and very low. Infants (6 to 23 months; 13 reviews) Iron supplementation increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia and IDA in two reviews. Iron fortification of milk or cereals, multiple‐micronutrient powder (MMNP), home fortification of complementary foods, and supplementary feeding increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia in six reviews. In one review, lipid‐based nutrient supplementation (LNS) reduced the risk of anaemia. In another, caterpillar cereal increased Hb levels and reduced IDA prevalence. Food‐based strategies (red meat and fortified cow's milk, beef) showed no evidence of a difference (1 review). Preschool and school‐aged children (2 to 10 years; 8 reviews) Daily or intermittent iron supplementation increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia and ID in two reviews. One review found no evidence of difference in Hb levels, but an increased risk of anaemia and ID for the intermittent regime. All suggested that zinc plus iron supplementation versus zinc alone, multiple‐micronutrient (MMN)‐fortified beverage versus control, and point‐of‐use fortification of food with iron‐containing micronutrient powder (MNP) versus placebo or no intervention may increase Hb levels and reduce the risk of anaemia and ID. Fortified dairy products and cereal food showed no evidence of a difference on the incidence of anaemia (1 review). Adolescent children (11 to 18 years; 4 reviews) Compared with no supplementation or placebo, five types of iron supplementation may increase Hb levels and reduce the risk of anaemia (3 reviews). One review on prevention found no evidence of a difference in anaemia incidence on iron supplementation with or without folic acid, but Hb levels increased. Another suggested that nutritional supplementation and counselling reduced IDA. One review comparing MMN fortification with no fortification observed no evidence of a difference in Hb levels. Non‐pregnant women of reproductive age (19 to 49 years; 5 reviews) Two reviews suggested that iron therapy (oral, intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM)) increased Hb levels; one showed that iron folic acid supplementation reduced anaemia incidence; and another that daily iron supplementation with or without folic acid or vitamin C increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia and ID. No review reported interventions related to fortification or dietary diversity and quality. Pregnant women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years; 23 reviews) One review apiece suggested that: daily iron supplementation with or without folic acid increased Hb levels in the third trimester or at delivery and in the postpartum period, and reduced the risk of anaemia, IDA and ID in the third trimester or at delivery; intermittent iron supplementation had no effect on Hb levels and IDA, but increased the risk of anaemia at or near term and ID, and reduced the risk of side effects; vitamin A supplementation alone versus placebo, no intervention or other micronutrient might increase maternal Hb levels and reduce the risk of maternal anaemia; MMN with iron and folic acid versus placebo reduced the risk of anaemia; supplementation with oral bovine lactoferrin versus oral ferrous iron preparations increased Hb levels and reduced gastrointestinal side effects; MNP for point‐of‐use fortification of food versus iron and folic acid supplementation might decrease Hb levels at 32 weeks' gestation and increase the risk of anaemia; and LNS versus iron or folic acid and MMN increased the risk of anaemia. Mixed population (all ages; 22 reviews) Iron supplementation versus placebo or control increased Hb levels in healthy children, adults, and elderly people (4 reviews). Hb levels appeared to increase and risk of anaemia and ID decrease in two reviews investigating MMN fortification versus placebo or no treatment, iron fortified flour versus control, double fortified salt versus iodine only fortified salt, and rice fortification with iron alone or in combination with other micronutrients versus unfortified rice or no intervention. Each review suggested that fortified versus non‐fortified condiments or noodles, fortified (sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate; NaFeEDTA) versus non‐fortified soy sauce, and double‐fortified salt versus control salt may increase Hb concentration and reduce the risk of anaemia. One review indicated that Hb levels increased for children who were anaemic or had IDA and received iron supplementation, and decreased for those who received dietary interventions. Another assessed the effects of foods prepared in iron pots, and found higher Hb levels in children with low‐risk malaria status in two trials, but no difference when comparing food prepared in non‐cast iron pots in a high‐risk malaria endemicity mixed population. There was no evidence of a difference for adverse effects. Anaemia and malaria prevalence were rarely reported. No review focused on women aged 50 to 65 years plus or men (19 to 65 years plus). Authors' conclusions Compared to no treatment, daily iron supplementation may increase Hb levels and reduce the risk of anaemia and IDA in infants, preschool and school‐aged children and pregnant and non‐pregnant women. Iron fortification of foods in infants and use of iron pots with children may have prophylactic benefits for malaria endemicity low‐risk populations. In any age group, only a limited number of reviews assessed interventions to improve dietary diversity and quality. Future trials should assess the effects of these types of interventions, and consider the requirements of different populations. Plain language summary Interventions throughout life for the prevention or treatment of anaemia What is the issue? Anaemia (low iron levels in the blood) is a health problem worldwide, caused by nutritional (e.g. nutrient deficiencies) or non‐nutritional (e.g. diseases or genetic disorders) factors. Its health consequences include fatigue, loss of productivity and adverse pregnancy and child outcomes. Why is this important? Iron deficiency (ID) is a common cause of nutritional anaemia, resulting from a lack of iron in the diet or reduced absorption of iron in the body (e.g. components in coffee, tea or cocoa inhibit iron absorption, while beverages and foods high in vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, enhance iron absorption). Some types of anaemia are preventable or controllable with iron supplementation (via capsules or drops), fortification (food enriched with sprinkles or powders containing iron) or improvements to diet diversity and quality (e.g. education or counselling). What evidence did we find? Infants (6 to 23 months) Two reviews suggested that iron supplementation increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels, and reduced the risk of anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) compared with placebo, no intervention or other interventions. Six reviews suggested that iron fortification of milk or cereals, multiple‐micronutrient powder (MMNP), home fortification of complementary foods and supplementary feeding increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia. In one review apiece, lipid‐based nutrient supplementation (LNS) reduced the risk of anaemia, while caterpillar cereal increased Hb levels and reduced IDA prevalence. Preschool and school‐aged children (2 to 10 years) Two reviews suggested that daily or intermittent (e.g. 1 to 3 times per week) iron supplementation increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia and ID. For daily versus intermittent iron supplementation, one review found no difference in Hb levels, but an increased risk of anaemia and ID for the intermittent regime. One review apiece found higher Hb levels and reduced risk of anaemia and ID for zinc plus iron supplementation versus zinc alone, multiple‐micronutrient (MMN)‐fortified beverages, and point‐of‐use fortification of food with iron‐containing micronutrient powder (MNP). Adolescent children (11 to 18 years) Three reviews for prevention or treatment suggested that intermittent iron supplementation alone or in combination with other micronutrients, iron supplementation with or without folic acid supplementation, or other micronutrient supplementation increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia. One review suggested that nutritional supplementation and counselling reduced IDA. In one review for prevention, iron supplementation with or without folic acid appeared to increase Hb levels but have no effect on the incidence of anaemia. Non‐pregnant women of reproductive age (19 to 49 years) Two reviews suggested that iron therapy (oral, intravenous, intramuscular) increased Hb levels. One review found that intravenous iron increased Hb levels compared with oral iron, and another that daily iron supplementation with or without folic acid or vitamin C increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia and ID. Pregnant women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) In one review, daily iron supplementation with or without folic acid increased Hb levels in the third trimester or at delivery, and in the postpartum period, and reduced the risk of anaemia, IDA and ID in the third trimester or at delivery. Six reviews suggested that intravenous iron versus oral iron or intramuscular iron increased Hb levels. In one review, vitamin A supplementation alone versus placebo, no intervention or other micronutrient increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia for the mother. One review found that supplementation with oral bovine lactoferrin versus oral ferrous iron preparations increased Hb levels and reduced gastrointestinal side effects. In one review, compared to iron or folic acid and MMNs, LNS increased the risk of anaemia. Mixed population (all ages) Iron supplementation versus placebo or control increased Hb levels in healthy children, adults, and elderly people in four reviews. In two reviews, MMN fortification versus placebo or no treatment increased Hb levels in children, as did iron supplementation, but Hb levels decreased for those receiving dietary interventions. Intravenous iron resulted in higher Hb levels than oral iron in one review. In another, vitamin B 12  or folic acid supplementation did not increase Hb levels. Each review suggested that iron fortification of food, iron‐fortified soy sauce, double‐fortified salt with iron and iodine, and fortified condiments or noodles increased Hb levels and reduced the risk of anaemia. In one review, foods prepared in iron pots showed the potential to increase Hb levels in children. No review focused on older adult women (50 to 65 years plus) or men (19 to 65 years plus), and anaemia and malaria prevalence were rarely reported. What does this mean? Compared to no treatment, daily iron supplementation may increase Hb levels and reduce the risk of anaemia and IDA in infants, preschool and school‐aged children and pregnant and non‐pregnant women. Iron fortification of foods in infants and use of iron pots with children may have benefits for low‐risk populations. Many trials reported the effects of supplementations, but very few reviews focused on fortification or improving diet diversity and quality. Future trials should focus on different types of interventions to increase food variety and dietary quality.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anemia [epidemiology, prevention & control]; *Anemia, Iron-Deficiency [epidemiology, prevention & control]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Child; Dietary Supplements; Female; Food, Fortified; Humans; Iron; Life Cycle Stages; Male; Micronutrients; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD013092.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013092.pub2","Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems"

Specific kinds of beds, overlays and mattresses are widely used with the aim of preventing and treating pressure ulcers. Objectives To summarise evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assess the effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and on increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. To assess the relative effects of different types of beds, overlays and mattresses for reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. To cumulatively rank the different treatment options of beds, overlays and mattresses in order of their effectiveness in pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. Methods In July 2020, we searched the Cochrane Library. Cochrane Reviews reporting the effectiveness of beds, mattresses or overlays for preventing or treating pressure ulcers were eligible for inclusion in this overview. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and risk of bias assessment using the ROBIS tool. We summarised the reported evidence in an overview of reviews. Where possible, we included the randomised controlled trials from each included review in network meta‐analyses. We assessed the relative effectiveness of beds, overlays and mattresses for preventing or treating pressure ulcers and their probabilities of being, comparably, the most effective treatment. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We include six Cochrane Reviews in this overview of reviews, all at low or unclear risk of bias. Pressure ulcer prevention:  four reviews (of 68 studies with 18,174 participants) report direct evidence for 27 pairwise comparisons between 12 types of support surface on the following outcomes: pressure ulcer incidence, time to pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, health‐related quality of life, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. (1) Pressure ulcer incidence: our overview includes direct evidence for 27 comparisons that mostly (19/27) have very low‐certainty evidence concerning reduction of pressure ulcer risk. We included 40 studies (12,517 participants; 1298 participants with new ulcers) in a network meta‐analysis involving 13 types of intervention. Data informing the network are sparse and this, together with the high risk of bias in most studies informing the network, means most network contrasts (64/78) yield evidence of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces (e.g. static air overlays) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.75), alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (e.g. alternating pressure air mattresses, large‐celled ripple mattresses) (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93), and reactive gel surfaces (e.g. gel pads used on operating tables) (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01) may reduce pressure ulcer incidence. The ranking of treatments in terms of effectiveness is also of very low certainty for all interventions. It is unclear which treatment is best for preventing ulceration. (2) Time to pressure ulcer incidence: four reviews had direct evidence on this outcome for seven comparisons. We included 10 studies (7211 participants; 699 participants with new ulcers) evaluating six interventions in a network meta‐analysis. Again, data from most network contrasts (13/15) are of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces may reduce the hazard of developing new pressure ulcers (hazard ratio (HR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.05). The ranking of all support surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers in terms of time to healing is uncertain. (3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for three comparisons. For preventing pressure ulcers, alternating pressure air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces (moderate‐certainty evidence). Pressure ulcer treatment:  two reviews (of 12 studies with 972 participants) report direct evidence for five comparisons on: complete pressure ulcer healing, time to complete pressure ulcer healing, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. (1) Complete pressure ulcer healing: our overview includes direct evidence for five comparisons. There is uncertainty about the relative effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on ulcer healing. The corresponding network meta‐analysis (with four studies, 397 participants) had only three direct contrasts and a total of six network contrasts. Again, most network contrasts (5/6) have very low‐certainty evidence. There was low‐certainty evidence that more people with pressure ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than using foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80). We are uncertain which surfaces have the highest probability of being the most effective (all very low‐certainty evidence). (2) Time to complete pressure ulcer healing: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have healed pressure ulcers compared with those using foam surfaces in long‐term care settings (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low‐certainty evidence). (3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer‐free day in the first year of use in long‐term care settings (low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and may increase complete ulcer healing. Compared with foam surfaces, alternating pressure air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and are probably more cost‐effective in preventing pressure ulcers. Compared with foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk, particularly for people in operating rooms and long‐term care settings. There are uncertainties for the relative effectiveness of other support surfaces for preventing and treating pressure ulcers, and their efficacy ranking. More high‐quality research is required; for example, for the comparison of reactive air surfaces with alternating pressure air surfaces. Future studies should consider time‐to‐event outcomes and be designed to minimise any risk of bias. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing and treating pressure ulcers? The overview presents a lot of data from randomised controlled trials and contains an advanced analysis called 'network meta‐analysis'. The analysis allows comparisons of all types of support surfaces for preventing or treating pressure ulcers. This interactive tool may help with navigation of the data   https://stopthepressure.shinyapps.io/Cochrane_support_surface_reviews/ . Key messages Static air mattresses or overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays, and gel pads used on operating tables may be better than foam mattresses for preventing pressure ulcers. Compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers. Static air mattresses or overlays may be better than foam mattresses for ulcer healing, but may cost more. It is unclear what the best treatment is for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers; what the effects of these treatment options are on people’s comfort and quality of life; and whether or not there are any unwanted effects. What are pressure ulcers? Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores or bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure or rubbing. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. What did we want to find out? There are many types of beds, mattresses and overlays specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells and gel pads) and are divided into two groups: ‐ reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin; and ‐ active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. We wanted to find out if different types of reactive and active surfaces: ‐ prevent pressure ulcers; ‐ help ulcers to heal; ‐ are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life; ‐ have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and ‐ have any unwanted effects. We also wanted to find out what the best treatment options are for either preventing or healing pressure ulcers. What did we do? We searched for Cochrane Reviews that summarised the results of all available carefully designed studies (controlled trials) evaluating different beds, mattresses and overlays in preventing and treating pressure ulcers. A Cochrane Review provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. We summarised the results of these reviews in a single document (called an overview of reviews). We also collected studies included in these reviews and compared all available treatments at the same time in a single analysis (called network meta‐analysis). We then summarised these results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? Effects in preventing pressure ulcers We found four reviews on the use of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing pressure ulcers. From these, we included 40 studies (12,517 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating reduction of pressure ulcer risk. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that static (reactive) air overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses, and (reactive) gel pads used on operating tables may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam mattresses. We also included 10 studies (7211 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating the time taken for new ulcers to develop. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces may reduce the chances of developing new ulcers compared with foam surfaces. Effects in treating pressure ulcers We found two reviews on pressure ulcer healing. From these, we included four studies (397 people) in a network meta‐analysis. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that more people with ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than foam surfaces. The overview evidence suggests that, if the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at, reactive air surfaces may improve the chances of pressure ulcers healing when compared with foam mattresses. However, it is unclear which treatment is best for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers. Other effects in preventing and treating pressure ulcers The overview evidence suggests that: ‐ compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air surfaces probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers; ‐ reactive air‐filled surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses in healing ulcers; and ‐ the other benefits and risks of these beds, mattresses and mattress overlays are unclear. What are the limitations of the evidence? Although the reviews we found used reliable methods, most of the studies in them were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence in this overview is current to July 2020.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Bedding and Linens; *Beds; Humans; Incidence; Network Meta-Analysis; Pressure Ulcer [epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD013761.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013761.pub2","Wounds"

In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta‐analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost‐effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. Methods This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non‐pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self‐help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta‐analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta‐regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. Main results We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta‐analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high‐certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair‐wise meta‐analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair‐wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low‐to very low‐certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Authors' conclusions Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost‐effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed. Plain language summary Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking? Key messages Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects. Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. Stopping smoking The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking. Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out: – which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking; – the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and – what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking. We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. Search date:  we included evidence published up to July 2020. What we found We found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with: – no behavioural support; – usual or standard care; – less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches. We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. What are the main results of our review? Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. Compared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. We are uncertain about: – the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and – the effect of who gives the behavioural support. Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. How confident are we in our results? We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. More studies are needed.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Network Meta-Analysis; *Systematic Reviews as Topic; Adult; Bayes Theorem; Behavior Therapy [*methods]; Bias; Counseling; Exercise; Female; Humans; Hypnosis; Male; Middle Aged; Publication Bias [statistics & numerical data]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic [statistics & numerical data]; Self Care; Smoking Cessation [*methods]; Time Factors; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD013229.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013229.pub2","Tobacco Addiction"

It remains a major public health concern globally. Antenatal interventions may reduce stillbirths and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in settings with high rates of stillbirth. There are several key antenatal strategies that aim to prevent stillbirth including nutrition, and prevention and management of infections. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of antenatal interventions for preventing stillbirth for low risk or unselected populations of women. Methods We collaborated with Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Information Specialist to identify all their published reviews that specified or reported stillbirth; and we searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (search date: 29 Feburary 2020) to identify reviews published within other Cochrane groups. The primary outcome measure was stillbirth but in the absence of stillbirth data, we used perinatal mortality (both stillbirth and death in the first week of life), fetal loss or fetal death as outcomes. Two review authors independently evaluated reviews for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality of evidence using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Reviews) and GRADE tools. We assigned interventions to categories with graphic icons to classify the effectiveness of interventions as: clear evidence of benefit or harm; clear evidence of no effect or equivalence; possible benefit or harm; or unknown benefit or harm or no effect or equivalence. Main results We identified 43 Cochrane Reviews that included interventions in pregnant women with the potential for preventing stillbirth; all of the included reviews reported our primary outcome 'stillbirth' or in the absence of stillbirth, 'perinatal death' or 'fetal loss/fetal death'. AMSTAR quality was high in 40 reviews with scores ranging from 8 to 11 and moderate in three reviews with a score of 7. Nutrition interventions Clear evidence of benefit:  balanced energy/protein supplementation versus no supplementation suggests a probable reduction in stillbirth (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.94, 5 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 3408 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Clear evidence of no effect or equivalence for stillbirth or perinatal death:  vitamin A alone versus placebo or no treatment; and multiple micronutrients with iron and folic acid versus iron with or without folic acid. Unknown benefit or harm or no effect or equivalence:  for all other nutrition interventions examined the effects were uncertain. Prevention and management of infections Possible benefit for fetal loss or death:  insecticide‐treated anti‐malarial nets versus no nets (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97, 4 RCTs; low‐certainty). Unknown evidence of no effect or equivalence:  drugs for preventing malaria (stillbirth RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.36, 5 RCTs, 7130 women, moderate certainty in women of all parity; perinatal death RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.63, 4 RCTs, 5216 women, moderate‐certainty in women of all parity). Prevention, detection and management of other morbidities Clear evidence of benefit : the following interventions suggest a reduction: midwife‐led models of care in settings where the midwife is the primary healthcare provider particularly for low‐risk pregnant women (overall fetal loss/neonatal death reduction RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99, 13 RCTs, 17,561 women; high‐certainty), training versus not training traditional birth attendants in rural populations of low‐ and middle‐income countries (stillbirth reduction odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83, 1 RCT, 18,699 women, moderate‐certainty; perinatal death reduction OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83, 1 RCT, 18,699 women, moderate‐certainty). Clear evidence of harm:  a reduced number of antenatal care visits probably results in an increase in perinatal death (RR 1.14 95% CI 1.00 to 1.31, 5 RCTs, 56,431 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Clear evidence of no effect or equivalence:  there was evidence of no effect in the risk of stillbirth/fetal loss or perinatal death for the following interventions and comparisons: psychosocial interventions; and providing case notes to women. Possible benefit:  community‐based intervention packages (including community support groups/women's groups, community mobilisation and home visitation, or training traditional birth attendants who made home visits) may result in a reduction of stillbirth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.91, 15 RCTs, 201,181 women; low‐certainty) and perinatal death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.86, 17 RCTs, 282,327 women; low‐certainty). Unknown benefit or harm or no effect or equivalence:  the effects were uncertain for other interventions examined. Screening and management of fetal growth and well‐being Clear evidence of benefit:  computerised antenatal cardiotocography for assessing infant's well‐being in utero compared with traditional antenatal cardiotocography (perinatal mortality reduction RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.88, 2 RCTs, 469 women; moderate‐certainty). Unknown benefit or harm or no effect or equivalence:  the effects were uncertain for other interventions examined. Authors' conclusions While most interventions were unable to demonstrate a clear effect in reducing stillbirth or perinatal death, several interventions suggested a clear benefit, such as balanced energy/protein supplements, midwife‐led models of care, training versus not training traditional birth attendants, and antenatal cardiotocography. Possible benefits were also observed for insecticide‐treated anti‐malarial nets and community‐based intervention packages, whereas a reduced number of antenatal care visits were shown to be harmful. However, there was variation in the effectiveness of interventions across different settings, indicating the need to carefully understand the context in which these interventions were tested. Further high‐quality RCTs are needed to evaluate the effects of antenatal preventive interventions and which approaches are most effective to reduce the risk of stillbirth. Stillbirth (or fetal death), perinatal and neonatal death need to be reported separately in future RCTs of antenatal interventions to allow assessment of different interventions on these rare but important outcomes and they need to clearly define the target populations of women where the intervention is most likely to be of benefit. As the high burden of stillbirths occurs in low‐ and middle‐income countries, further high‐quality trials need to be conducted in these settings as a priority. Plain language summary What are the most effective interventions during pregnancy for preventing stillbirth? What is stillbirth? A stillbirth is generally defined as the death of a baby before birth, at or after 22 weeks of development. Why is this important? Stillbirth can be very upsetting for families. It is most common in low‐ and middle‐income countries but also affects people in high‐income countries. Numbers of stillbirths have not fallen much in the last 20 years and, despite the high numbers, it is not widely recognised as a global health problem. It is important to raise awareness of effective methods of preventing stillbirths, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. What did we do? Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions aim to answer specific medical questions based on up‐to‐date research studies. We searched for all Cochrane systematic reviews that assessed ways of preventing stillbirth during pregnancy to produce an overview of Cochrane evidence on preventing stillbirth. What evidence did we find? We found 43 Cochrane reviews that assessed 61 different ways of preventing stillbirth during pregnancy, or infant deaths around the time of birth. However, few of these provided any clear evidence of an effect during pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth or infant death. We grouped them into four different areas: nutrition, preventing infection, managing mothers' other healthcare problems, and looking after the baby before it is born. Nutrition ‐ Giving mothers balanced energy and protein supplements to increase the growth of the baby, particularly in undernourished pregnant women, probably reduces stillbirth by 40%. ‐ For Vitamin A alone versus placebo (sham) or no treatment, and multiple micronutrients with iron and folic acid compared with iron with or without folic acid, there was clear evidence of no effect. Prevention and management of infections ‐ Insecticide‐treated anti‐malarial nets versus no nets may reduce loss of the baby in the womb (fetus) by 33%. Prevention, detection and management of other healthcare problems ‐ Where midwives were the primary healthcare provider, particularly for low‐risk pregnant women, loss of the fetus or infant deaths fell by 16%. ‐ Having a trained traditional birth attendant versus having an untrained traditional birth attendant probably reduces stillbirth in rural populations of low‐ and middle‐income countries by 31% and infant death by 30%. ‐ A reduced number of antenatal care visits probably results in an increase in infant death around the time of birth. ‐ Community‐based intervention packages (including community‐support groups/women's groups, community mobilisation and home visits, or training traditional birth attendants who made home visits) may reduce stillbirth by 19%. Checking the baby before birth ‐ Cardiotocography measures the baby's heart rate and contractions in the womb. It can be recorded automatically by computer or manually, with pen and paper. Computerised cardiotocography to monitor baby’s well‐being in the womb, by measuring contractions, probably reduces the rate of infant deaths around the time of birth by 80% when compared with traditional cardiotocography. We were uncertain about the effects of other methods. What does this mean? We found a large number of reviews but few produced clear evidence. The effectiveness of the methods used to prevent stillbirth varied depending on where they took place, highlighting that it is important to understand how they were tested. The findings cannot be applied to women in general and across all global settings.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Stillbirth; Cardiotocography; Female; Fetal Death [*prevention & control]; Fetal Development; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Midwifery; Nutrition Assessment; Perinatal Death [*prevention & control]; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care [*methods, statistics & numerical data]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Systematic Reviews as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD009599.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009599.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"

The efficacy of interventions for mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment may differ in this population. Objectives With this overview of systematic reviews, we will map the characteristics and methodological quality of existing systematic reviews and registered systematic review protocols on the promotion of mental health and prevention and treatment of common mental disorders among refugees, asylum seekers, and IDPs. The findings from this overview will be used to prioritise and inform future Cochrane reviews on the mental health of involuntary migrants. Methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1945 onwards), Ovid Embase (1974 onwards), Ovid PsycINFO, ProQuest PTSDpubs, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NIHR Journals Library, CRD databases (archived), DoPHER, Epistemonikos, Health Evidence, 3ie International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, and PROSPERO, to identify systematic reviews of mental health interventions for involuntary migrants. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches. We included systematic reviews or protocols for systematic reviews of interventions aimed at refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Interventions must have been aimed at mental health promotion (for example, classroom‐based well‐being interventions for children), prevention of mental health problems (for example, trauma‐focussed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder), or treatment of common mental disorders and symptoms (for example, narrative exposure therapy to treat symptoms of trauma). After screening abstracts and full‐text manuscripts in duplicate, we extracted data on the characteristics of the reviews, the interventions examined in reviews, and the number of primary studies included in each review. Methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. Main results The overview includes 23 systematic reviews and 15 registered systematic review protocols. Of the 23 published systematic reviews, meta‐analyses were conducted in eight reviews. It was more common for the search strategy or inclusion criteria of the reviews to state that studies involving refugees were eligible for inclusion (23/23), than for asylum seekers (14/23) or IDPs (7/23) to be explicitly mentioned. In most reviews, study eligiblity was either not restricted by participant age (9/23), or restricted to adults (10/23). Reviews commonly reported on studies of diagnosis or symptoms of post‐traumatic stress disorder or trauma (11/23) and were less likely to report on depression or anxiety (6/23). In 15 reviews the intervention of interest was focused on/ specific to psychological therapy. Across all 23 reviews, the interventions most commonly identified from primary studies were general Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and a range of different integrative and interpersonal therapies. Even though many reviews included studies of participants without a diagnosis of a mental health problem, they often assessed mental health treatments and did not usually distinguish between promotion, prevention, and treatment in the review aims. Together the 23 systematic reviews included 336 references, of which 175 were unique primary studies. Limitations to the methodological quality of reviews most commonly related to reporting of selection criteria (21/23), absence of a protocol (19/23), reporting of study design (20/23), search strategy (22/23), and funding sources of primary studies (19/23). Authors' conclusions Gaps exist in the evidence on mental health interventions for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Most reviews do not specify that internally displaced persons are included in the selection criteria, even though they make up the majority of involuntary migrants worldwide. Reviews specific to mental health promotion and prevention of common mental disorders are missing, and there is more evidence available for adults or mixed populations than for children. The literature is focused on post‐traumatic stress disorder and trauma‐related symptoms, with less attention for depression and anxiety disorders. Better quality systematic reviews and better report of review design and methods would help those who may use these reviews to inform implementation of mental health interventions. Plain language summary An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants Refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons are involuntary migrants, who have often experienced distress when forced to leave their home, on the journey, and in the process of settling in a host country or new environment. Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post‐traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. We searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom‐based well‐being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma‐focused therapy to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. The quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. The evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence‐based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Health Promotion; *Mental Health; *Systematic Reviews as Topic; Humans; Mental Disorders [prevention & control, *therapy]; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Refugees [classification, *psychology]; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic [therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD013458.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013458.pub2","Common Mental Disorders"

An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first‐line therapy (inhaled short‐acting beta‐agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first‐line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management. Objectives Main objective ‐ To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta‐analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second‐line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first‐line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives ‐ To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews ‐ To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews ‐ To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review Methods We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'. Main results We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high‐certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 ‐agonists (moderate‐certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high‐certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low‐certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate‐certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate‐certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 ‐agonists (low‐certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high‐certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate‐certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low‐certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high. Authors' conclusions This overview provides the most up‐to‐date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 ‐agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi‐centre research will be required to generate high‐quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high‐flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials. Plain language summary Interventions for acute severe asthma attacks in children: an overview of Cochrane Reviews Background Asthma is a common childhood illness that is caused by narrowing of the small air passages in the lungs. This narrowing is due to swelling and inflammation and to muscles around the air passages becoming tighter. An acute asthma attack results in shortness of breath, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness. When children have an asthma attack, the standard treatment is to give steroids to reduce inflammation and swelling (usually given by mouth) and inhaled medications to relax the muscles in the air passages (called ""bronchodilators""). In this review, we call that standard treatment ""first‐line"" treatment. These medications are well understood to be the best treatments for use in the first instance. Some children's asthma attacks do not improve with first‐line treatment, and more treatment is necessary ‐ usually at the emergency department or hospital; in this review, we call this 'second‐line' treatment. However, the best second‐line treatment for children who do not respond to first‐line treatment is poorly understood. Many treatment options are available, and what is done for children varies from hospital to hospital. We wanted to look at existing Cochrane Reviews of second‐line treatments for children having asthma attacks. We hoped to be able to bring this information together in a useful document and to be able to present the evidence that would help the practitioner make the best treatment decision for each child having an asthma attack when inhaled bronchodilators and oral steroids have not helped with symptoms. Review question What is the effectiveness and safety of treatment options available for children with acute asthma who do not improve with standard first‐line treatment? Study characteristics We included 13 Cochrane Systematic Reviews on various treatment options, including inhaled medication, intravenous medications, and other therapies. This overview provides the most up‐to‐date evidence from systematic reviews with meta‐analyses of randomised controlled trials on acute severe asthma in children. This overview is current to December 2019. Quality of the evidence The quality of these reviews was assessed using a checklist, which helped us assess the risk of bias. Nine of the 13 reviews were considered to be high quality. Four reviews were considered at risk of bias due to concerns with the way studies were identified for inclusion in the reviews. Most of the reviews are out‐of‐date because they have not been updated since 2016. The quality of evidence for specific comparisons ranged from very low to high, with many results coming from small studies. It is difficult to be confident in making recommendations for clinical practice. Key results For children with acute severe asthma requiring additional treatment, we found that: ‐ intravenous magnesium sulfate (a bronchodilator given through a vein) appears to reduce the length of time spent in hospital; ‐ no evidence suggests that any treatment reduced the risk of being admitted to intensive care; ‐ some treatments appeared to reduce the risk of hospital admission. These included adding a second type of inhaled bronchodilator treatment (anticholinergic medication such as ipratropium bromide) to standard inhaled treatment (beta‐agonist such as salbutamol), giving intravenous magnesium sulfate, and breathing a mixture of helium and oxygen; ‐ serious adverse events may be reduced by inhaled magnesium sulfate; ‐ nausea and/or vomiting is more common with aminophylline (another bronchodilator medication given through a vein); and ‐ adding a second type of inhaled bronchodilator treatment (anticholinergic medication such as Ipratropium bromide) reduces the risk of nausea and tremor but not vomiting. Recommendations for future research One of the major problems with existing research is that a small number of patients is included in each study, likely because severe acute asthma in children is relatively uncommon. To work out whether or not a treatment is effective and/or to tell the difference between treatments, a research study must include enough patients receiving each treatment. Therefore, high‐quality research into severe acute asthma in children is likely to require studies that include a number of hospitals. It is also important to be able to compare results across studies. To do this, researchers across the world should agree on a standard way of measuring results in studies of acute severe asthma in children.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Disease Progression; *Systematic Reviews as Topic; Acute Disease; Administration, Inhalation; Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists [therapeutic use]; Aminophylline [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Anti-Asthmatic Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Asthma [drug therapy, *therapy]; Bias; Bronchodilator Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholinergic Antagonists [therapeutic use]; Helium; Humans; Infant; Length of Stay; Leukotriene Antagonists [therapeutic use]; Magnesium Sulfate [administration & dosage, adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Nausea [chemically induced, prevention & control]; Oxygen [administration & dosage]; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vomiting [chemically induced]; Work of Breathing [drug effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD012977.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012977.pub2","Airways"

Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews evaluating interventions for heavy menstrual bleeding that are commonly available during pandemics. Methods We sought published Cochrane Reviews, evaluating interventions that can continue during pandemics for women with heavy menstrual bleeding with no known underlying cause. We identified Cochrane Reviews by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in June 2020. The primary outcome was menstrual bleeding. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient satisfaction, side effects, and serious adverse events. We undertook the selection of systematic reviews, data extraction, and quality assessment in duplicate. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool, and the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. Main results We included four Cochrane Reviews, with 11 comparisons, data from 44 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 3196 women. We assessed all the reviews to be high quality. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs may be more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding than placebo (mean difference (MD) ‐124 mL per cycle, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐186 to ‐62 mL per cycle; 1 RCT, 11 women; low‐certainty evidence). Mefenamic acid may be similar to naproxen (MD 21 mL per cycle, 95% CI ‐6 to 48 mL per cycle; 2 RCTs, 61 women; low‐certainty evidence), and NSAIDs may be similar to combined hormonal contraceptives for heavy menstrual bleeding (MD 25 mL per cycle, 95% CI ‐22 to 73 mL per cycle; 1 RCT, 26 women; low‐certainty evidence). NSAIDs may be be less effective in reducing menstrual bleeding than antifibrinolytics (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85; 2 RCTs, 161 women; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether NSAIDs reduce menstrual blood loss more than short‐cycle progestogens (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 1 RCT 32 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics Antifibrinolytics appear to be more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding than placebo (MD  ‐ 53 mL per cycle, 95% CI ‐63 to ‐44 mL per cycle; 4 RCTs, 565 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may be similar to placebo on the incidence of side effects (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 297 women; low‐certainty evidence), and they are probably similar on the incidence of serious adverse events (thrombotic events; RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.46; 2 RCT, 468 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may be more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding than short‐cycle progestogen (MD ‐111 mL per cycle, 95% CI ‐178 mL to ‐44 mL per cycle; 1 RCT, 46 women; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics are similar to short‐cycle progestogens on quality of life (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 1 RCT, 44 women; very low‐certainty evidence), patient satisfaction (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.39; 1 RCT, 42 women; very low‐certainty evidence), or side effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 211 women; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics are more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding when compared with long‐cycle progestogen (MD ‐9 points per cycle, 95% CI ‐30 to 12 points per cycle; 2 RCTs, 184 women; low‐certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may increase self‐reported improvement in menstrual bleeding when compared with long‐cycle medroxyprogesterone acetate (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.61; 1 RCT, 94 women; low‐certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may be similar to long‐cycle progestogens on quality of life (MD 5, 95% CI ‐2.49 to 12.49; 1 RCT, 90 women; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics are similar to long‐cycle progestogens on side effects (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.00; 2 RCTs, 184 women; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no trials comparing antifibrinolytics to combined hormonal contraceptives. Combined hormonal contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives appear to be more effective for heavy menstrual bleeding than placebo or no treatment (RR 13.25, 95% CI 2.94 to 59.64; 2 RCTs, 363 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Combined hormonal contraceptives are probably similar to placebo on the incidence of side effects (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.60; 2 RCTs, 411 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Progestogens There were no trials comparing progestogens to placebo. Limitations in the evidence included risk of bias in the primary RCTs, inconsistency between the primary RCTs, and imprecision in effect estimates. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐certainty evidence that antifibrinolytics and combined hormonal contraceptives reduce heavy menstrual bleeding compared with placebo. There is low‐certainty evidence that NSAIDs reduce heavy menstrual bleeding compared with placebo. There is low‐certainty evidence that antifibrinolytics are more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding when compared with NSAIDs and short‐cycle progestogens, but we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of antifibrinolytics compared to long‐cycle progestogens, on low‐certainty evidence. Plain language summary Interventions available during pandemics for heavy menstrual bleeding: an overview of Cochrane Reviews Review question What is the effectiveness and safety of treatments commonly available during pandemics for heavy menstrual bleeding? Background Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common gynaecological condition. Treatments that can continue during pandemics include: 1. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for example mefenamic acid or naproxen: these work by reducing prostaglandin levels, which reduces bleeding from the lining of the womb. NSAIDs can be taken as tablets. 2. Antifibrinolytics, for example tranexamic acid: these work in reducing bleeding by inhibiting clot‐dissolving enzymes in the lining of the womb. Antifibrinolytics can be taken as tablets. 3. Combined hormonal contraceptives, for example the combined oral contraceptive pill: these work by thinning the lining of the womb that is shed during menstrual periods. Combined hormonal contraceptives can be taken as tablets, or can be administered vaginally, using a vaginal ring. 4. Progestogens, for example norethisterone: these work by thinning the lining of the womb that is shed during menstrual periods. Progestogens are tablets, which can be taken for 10 days of the menstrual cycle (short‐cycle), or for three to four weeks of the menstrual cycle (long‐cycle). We aimed to summarise the best evidence regarding their effectiveness and safety. Study characteristics We included four Cochrane Reviews (44 randomised controlled trials, 3196 women), to June 2020. We identified 11 different comparisons, including NSAIDs compared with placebo (control tablet that has no effect), antifibrinolytics compared with placebo, and combined hormonal oral contraceptives compared with placebo. All reviews reported menstrual bleeding, quality of life, patient satisfaction, side effects, and serious adverse events. We rated all the reviews as high quality. Key results Antifibrinolytics and combined hormonal contraceptives are probably effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding when compared to placebo. Of 1000 women with heavy menstrual bleeding, 109 will report improvement with placebo, and 363 (range 200 to 662) with antifibrinolytics. Of 1000 women with heavy menstrual bleeding, 29 will perceive their menstrual bleeding is back to normal with placebo, and 401 (range 118 to 771) with combined oral contraceptive. NSAIDs may be effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding when compared to placebo. Of 1000 women with heavy menstrual bleeding, 200 will report improvement with placebo, and 766 (range 578 to 887) with NSAIDs. Antifibrinolytics may be more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding when compared with NSAIDs and short‐cycle progestogens, but we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of antifibrinolytics compared to long‐cycle progestogens. There was poor reporting of secondary outcomes, including quality of life, and the women's satisfaction with treatment. These studies did not have enough women participating to detect serious adverse events. There is well known evidence that even though the risk of thromboembolic events is very low in the general population, it increases with oral contraceptives. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence for different comparisons and outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. There were significant limitations in the primary research studies, inconsistency in results between primary research studies, and imprecision in the reviews' findings.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pandemics; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal [therapeutic use]; Antifibrinolytic Agents [therapeutic use]; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal [therapeutic use]; Female; Humans; Mefenamic Acid [therapeutic use]; Menorrhagia [*drug therapy]; Placebos [therapeutic use]; Progestins [therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic [statistics & numerical data]; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD013651.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013651.pub2","Gynaecology and Fertility"

There are associated short‐ and long‐term health risks for women and their babies. Objectives We aimed to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of interventions for preventing GDM. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (6 August 2019) with key words ‘gestational diabetes’ OR ’GDM’ to identify reviews pre‐specifying GDM as an outcome. We included reviews of interventions in women who were pregnant or planning a pregnancy, irrespective of their GDM risk status. Two overview authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and assessed quality of evidence using ROBIS and GRADE tools. We assigned interventions to categories with graphic icons to classify the effectiveness of interventions as: clear evidence of benefit or harm (GRADE moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence with a confidence interval (CI) that did not cross the line of no effect); clear evidence of no effect or equivalence (GRADE moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence with a narrow CI crossing the line of no effect); possible benefit or harm (low‐quality evidence with a CI that did not cross the line of no effect or GRADE moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence with a wide CI); or unknown benefit or harm (GRADE low‐quality evidence with a wide CI or very low‐quality evidence). Main results We included 11 Cochrane Reviews (71 trials, 23,154 women) with data on GDM. Nine additional reviews pre‐specified GDM as an outcome, but did not identify GDM data in included trials. Ten of the 11 reviews were judged to be at low risk of bias and one review at unclear risk of bias. Interventions assessed included diet, exercise, a combination of diet and exercise, dietary supplements, pharmaceuticals, and management of other health problems in pregnancy. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low. Diet Unknown benefit or harm:  there was unknown benefit or harm of dietary advice versus standard care, on the risk of GDM: risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.04; 5 trials; 1279 women; very low‐quality evidence. There was unknown benefit or harm of a low glycaemic index diet versus a moderate‐high glycaemic index diet on the risk of GDM: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.31; 4 trials; 912 women; low‐quality evidence. Exercise Unknown benefit or harm:  there was unknown benefit or harm for exercise interventions versus standard antenatal care on the risk of GDM: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.84; 3 trials; 826 women; low‐quality evidence. Diet and exercise combined Possible benefit:  combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy versus standard care possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; 19 trials; 6633 women; moderate‐quality evidence. Dietary supplements Clear evidence of no effect:  omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation versus none in pregnancy had no effect on the risk of GDM: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.26; 12 trials; 5235 women; high‐quality evidence. Possible benefit:  myo‐inositol supplementation during pregnancy versus control possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.64; 3 trials; 502 women; low‐quality evidence. Possible benefit : vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or control in pregnancy possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 4 trials; 446 women; low‐quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm:  there was unknown benefit or harm of probiotic with dietary intervention versus placebo with dietary intervention (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89; 1 trial; 114 women; very low‐quality evidence), or probiotic with dietary intervention versus control (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.92; 1 trial; 111 women; very low‐quality evidence) on the risk of GDM. There was unknown benefit or harm of vitamin D + calcium supplementation versus placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.84; 1 trial; 54 women; very low‐quality evidence) or vitamin D + calcium + other minerals versus calcium + other minerals (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.73; 1 trial; 1298 women; very low‐quality evidence) on the risk of GDM. Pharmaceutical Possible benefit:  metformin versus placebo given to obese pregnant women possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.19; 3 trials; 892 women; moderate‐quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm: eight small trials with low‐ to very low‐quality evidence showed unknown benefit or harm for heparin, aspirin, leukocyte immunisation or IgG given to women with a previous stillbirth on the risk of GDM. Management of other health issues Clear evidence of no effect:  universal versus risk based screening of pregnant women for thyroid dysfunction had no effect on the risk of GDM: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.25; 1 trial; 4516 women; moderate‐quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm:  there was unknown benefit or harm of using fractional exhaled nitrogen oxide versus a clinical algorithm to adjust asthma therapy on the risk of GDM: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.77; 1 trial; 210 women; low‐quality evidence. There was unknown benefit or harm of pharmacist led multidisciplinary approach to management of maternal asthma versus standard care on the risk of GDM: RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.82; 1 trial; 58 women; low‐quality evidence. Authors' conclusions No interventions to prevent GDM in 11 systematic reviews were of clear benefit or harm. A combination of exercise and diet, supplementation with myo‐inositol, supplementation with vitamin D and metformin were of possible benefit in reducing the risk of GDM, but further high‐quality evidence is needed. Omega‐3‐fatty acid supplementation and universal screening for thyroid dysfunction did not alter the risk of GDM. There was insufficient high‐quality evidence to establish the effect on the risk of GDM of diet or exercise alone, probiotics, vitamin D with calcium or other vitamins and minerals, interventions in pregnancy after a previous stillbirth, and different asthma management strategies in pregnancy. There is a lack of trials investigating the effect of interventions prior to or between pregnancies on risk of GDM. Plain language summary Interventions to prevent women from developing diabetes during pregnancy: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews What is the issue? Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) first detected during pregnancy. GDM can affect the health of women and their babies. During pregnancy a woman’s body changes how it processes the nutrients from her food, to ensure that the baby is well nourished. In the first three months the mother has increased sensitivity to insulin. In the second and third trimesters her insulin sensitivity is reduced. Women with GDM have less of an initial increase in sensitivity and their insulin sensitivity is reduced beyond normal later in pregnancy, resulting in the mother developing high blood glucose levels. Her blood levels of fats are also higher than normal, which may contribute to the risk of the baby becoming large for its gestational age. Why is this important? Women with GDM are more likely to develop complications in pregnancy including high blood pressure and need labour to be induced. They are at increased risk later of developing type 2 diabetes. Babies born to women with GDM are more likely to be born large, and therefore to experience birth injuries. Once born, the babies are at higher risk of experiencing difficulties in breathing, jaundice and reduced blood sugar levels, and later obesity and diabetes. There are many risk factors for GDM, making it likely that interventions before/during pregnancy could reduce the risk of women developing GDM. This overview summarises evidence from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials on interventions that might prevent GDM. What evidence did we find? We searched the Cochrane Library (August 2019) and identified 11 Cochrane Reviews that assessed interventions during pregnancy and reported on GDM. The reviews had findings from 71 randomised controlled trials involving 23,154 pregnant women. Interventions included diet, exercise, a combination of diet and exercise, dietary supplements, medications, and management of other health problems. The evidence from the trials ranged from very low to high quality. We identified a further 10 reviews that may provide more information on this topic in the future. Diet and exercise Diet and exercise together possibly reduced the risk of a woman developing GDM when compared to standard care (19 trials; 6633 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Dietary advice alone (5 trials; 1279 women; very low‐quality evidence) and a low glycaemic index diet compared with a moderate to high glycaemic index diet (4 trials; 912 women; low‐quality evidence) had an unclear effect on the risk of GDM. Exercise alone had an unclear effect on the risk of GDM (3 trials; 826 women; low‐quality evidence). Dietary supplements Omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation in pregnancy had no effect (12 trials; 5235 women; high‐quality evidence). Myo‐inositol supplementation during pregnancy possibly reduced the risk of GDM (3 trials with 502 women; low‐quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy had a possible benefit in reducing the risk of developing GDM (4 trials with 446 women; low‐quality evidence). These trials were all from Asian countries and the women’s vitamin D levels before supplementation were mostly unknown. Vitamin D given with calcium supplementation, or with calcium plus other minerals had an unclear effect. Probiotic with dietary intervention had an unclear effect on the risk of developing GDM. Medications The drug metformin had a possible benefit in reducing the risk of developing GDM when given to obese pregnant women (3 trials; 892 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Low‐ to very low‐quality evidence from eight small trials showed unclear effect on GDM risk for heparin, aspirin, leukocyte immunisation or immunoglobulin (IgG) given to women who had previously experienced a stillbirth. Management of other health issues Universal versus risk‐based screening for thyroid problems had no effect on the risk of GDM (1 trial; 4516 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Two different approaches to management of the mothers’ asthma had an unclear effect (low‐quality evidence). What does this mean? A combination of exercise and diet, supplementation with myo‐inositol and vitamin D supplementation were of possible benefit in reducing the risk of developing GDM. Further high‐quality evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed to confirm these results, and to look further at the use of metformin. No trials assessed interventions before pregnancy.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Systematic Reviews as Topic; Diabetes, Gestational [*prevention & control]; Diet, Diabetic; Dietary Supplements; Exercise; Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [administration & dosage]; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents [therapeutic use]; Inositol [therapeutic use]; Metformin [therapeutic use]; Pregnancy; Probiotics [administration & dosage]; Vitamin B Complex [therapeutic use]; Vitamin D; Vitamins [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD012394.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012394.pub3","Pregnancy and Childbirth"

Treatment typically includes pharmacological and non‐pharmacological approaches. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is an adjunct non‐pharmacological treatment commonly recommended by clinicians and often used by people with pain. Objectives To provide an overview of evidence from Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness of TENS to reduce pain in adults with chronic pain (excluding headache or migraine). To provide an overview of evidence from Cochrane Reviews of the safety of TENS when used to reduce pain in adults with chronic pain (excluding headache or migraine). To identify possible sources of inconsistency in the approaches taken to evaluating the evidence related to TENS for chronic pain (excluding headache or migraine) in the Cochrane Library with a view to recommending strategies to improve consistency in methodology and reporting. To highlight areas of remaining uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of TENS for chronic pain (excluding headache or migraine) with a view to recommending strategies to reduce any uncertainty. Methods Search methods We searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (CDSR), in the Cochrane Library, across all years up to Issue 11 of 12, 2018. Selection of reviews Two authors independently screened the results of the electronic search by title and abstract against inclusion/exclusion criteria. We included all Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of TENS in people with chronic pain. We included reviews if they investigated the following: TENS versus sham; TENS versus usual care or no treatment/waiting list control; TENS plus active intervention versus active intervention alone; comparisons between different types of TENS; or TENS delivered using different stimulation parameters. Data extraction and analysis Two authors independently extracted relevant data, assessed review quality using the AMSTAR checklist and applied GRADE judgements where required to individual reviews. Our primary outcomes included pain intensity and nature/incidence of adverse effects; our secondary outcomes included disability, health‐related quality of life, analgesic medication use and participant global impression of change. Main results We included nine reviews investigating TENS use in people with defined chronic pain or in people with chronic conditions associated with ongoing pain. One review investigating TENS for phantom or stump‐associated pain in people following amputation did not have any included studies. We therefore extracted data from eight reviews which represented 51 TENS‐related RCTs representing 2895 TENS‐comparison participants entered into the studies. The included reviews followed consistent methods and achieved overall high scores on the AMSTAR checklist. The evidence reported within each review was consistently rated as very low quality. Using review authors' assessment of risk of bias, there were significant methodological limitations in included studies; and for all reviews, sample sizes were consistently small (the majority of studies included fewer than 50 participants per group). Six of the eight reviews presented a narrative synthesis of included studies. Two reviews reported a pooled analysis. Primary and secondary outcomes One review reported a beneficial effect of TENS versus sham therapy at reducing pain intensity on a 0 to 10 scale (MD −1.58, 95% CI −2.08 to −1.09, P < 0.001, I² = 29%, P = 0.22, 5 studies, 207 participants). However the quality of the evidence was very low due to significant methodological limitations and imprecision. A second review investigating pain intensity performed a pooled analysis by combining studies that compared TENS to sham with studies that compared TENS to no intervention (SMD −0.85, 95% CI −1.36 to −0.34, P = 0.001, I² = 83%, P < 0.001). This pooled analysis was judged as offering very low quality evidence due to significant methodological limitations, large between‐trial heterogeneity and imprecision. We considered the approach of combining sham and no intervention data to be problematic since we would predict these different comparisons may be estimating different true effects. All remaining reviews also reported pain intensity as an outcome measure; however the data were presented in narrative review form only. Due to methodological limitation and lack of useable data, we were unable to offer any meaningful report on the remaining primary outcome regarding nature/incidence of adverse effects, nor for the remaining secondary outcomes: disability, health‐related quality of life, analgesic medication use and participant global impression of change for any comparisons. We found the included reviews had a number of inconsistencies when evaluating the evidence from TENS studies. Approaches to assessing risk of bias around the participant, personnel and outcome‐assessor blinding were perhaps the most obvious area of difference across included reviews. We also found wide variability in terms of primary and secondary outcome measures, and inclusion/exclusion criteria for studies varied with respect to including studies which assessed immediate effects of single interventions. Authors' conclusions We found the methodological quality of the reviews was good, but quality of the evidence within them was very low. We were therefore unable to conclude with any confidence that, in people with chronic pain, TENS is harmful, or beneficial for pain control, disability, health‐related quality of life, use of pain relieving medicines, or global impression of change. We make recommendations with respect to future TENS study designs which may meaningfully reduce the uncertainty relating to the effectiveness of this treatment in people with chronic pain. Plain language summary Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for chronic pain ‐ an overview of Cochrane Reviews Bottom line For people with chronic pain, this overview of Cochrane Reviews found it was not possible to confidently state whether TENS is effective in relieving pain compared to sham TENS, usual care/no treatment or when TENS is combined with another active treatment versus the active treatment alone. We were unable to find any reliable evidence that the effectiveness of TENS varies when using different delivery modes (e.g. different frequency, intensity or electrode placement). Background Chronic pain (pain for longer than three months) is associated with a range of common conditions and can be difficult to treat effectively. TENS is a common treatment for pain conditions and involves using a small battery‐operated unit to apply low‐intensity electrical current to the body using electrodes attached to the skin. This is suggested to relieve pain. TENS has been previously investigated by a number of Cochrane Reviews. Review question By identifying relevant Cochrane Reviews on TENS for common chronic pain conditions, we investigated whether TENS is effective in reducing pain in adults with chronic pain (excluding headache or migraine). Study characteristics As of November 2018, we found nine reviews eligible for inclusion. Seven reviews specifically investigated TENS for the treatment of pain/function in a variety of chronic conditions in adults. We also included one review investigating a range of electrotherapy modalities for neck pain and one review examining non‐pharmacological interventions in people with spinal cord injury. Both of these reviews included studies investigating TENS. Though the included reviews were of high quality, we found the quality of the evidence presented within the reviews to be very low. Key findings We are unable to confidently state whether TENS is effective in relieving pain in people with chronic pain. This is due to the very low quality of the evidence, and the overall small numbers of participants included in studies in the reviews. Issues with quality, study size and lack of data meant we were unable to draw any conclusion on TENS‐associated harms or side‐effects or the effect of TENS on disability, health‐related quality of life, use of pain‐relieving medicines or people's impression of how much TENS changed their condition.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Chronic Pain [*therapy]; Humans; Pain Management [*methods]; Pain Measurement; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation [*methods]; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD011890.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011890.pub3","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

To clear their lungs of mucus, people with cystic fibrosis perform airway clearance techniques daily. There are various airway clearance techniques, which differ in terms of the need for assistance or equipment, and cost. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the effectiveness and safety of various airway clearance techniques in people with cystic fibrosis. Methods For this overview, we included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials) that evaluated an airway clearance technique (conventional chest physiotherapy, positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy, high‐pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, external high frequency chest compression devices and exercise) in people with cystic fibrosis. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 29 November 2018. Two review authors independently evaluated reviews for eligibility. One review author extracted data from included reviews and a second author checked the data for accuracy. Two review authors independently graded the quality of reviews using the ROBIS tool. We used the GRADE approach for assessing the overall strength of the evidence for each primary outcome (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), individual preference and quality of life). Main results We included six Cochrane Reviews, one of which compared any type of chest physiotherapy with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone and the remaining five reviews included head‐to‐head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques. All the reviews were considered to have a low risk of bias. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report sufficient information to adequately assess risk of bias. Many trials did not sufficiently report on outcome measures and had a high risk of reporting bias. We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for comparisons of airway clearance techniques in terms of FEV 1 , except for reporting no difference between PEP therapy and oscillating devices after six months of treatment, mean difference ‐1.43% predicted (95% confidence interval ‐5.72 to 2.87); the quality of the body of evidence was graded as moderate. The quality of the body of evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes was either low or very low. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence to support the use of one airway clearance technique over another. People with cystic fibrosis should choose the airway clearance technique that best meets their needs, after considering comfort, convenience, flexibility, practicality, cost, or some other factor. More long‐term, high‐quality randomised controlled trials comparing airway clearance techniques among people with cystic fibrosis are needed. Plain language summary Airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews We reviewed the evidence from Cochrane Reviews about the effect of airway clearance techniques in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a life‐limiting genetic condition that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. People with cystic fibrosis produce thick mucus that builds up in the lungs leading to infections and inflammation and eventually to a deterioration in lung function. People with cystic fibrosis perform airway clearance techniques at least daily to help keep their lungs clear of mucus. There are various airway clearance techniques, which differ in terms of the need for assistance or equipment, and cost. The airway clearance techniques included in this overview are conventional chest physiotherapy, various breathing techniques (active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage), devices that create a positive pressure (positive expiratory pressure therapy (PEP) or high‐pressure PEP therapy) or a vibration (oscillating devices) to move mucus, and exercise. The condition is progressive and as lung function worsens, airway clearance techniques may not be sufficient. It may be useful to consider other therapies, such as hypertonic saline or dornase alfa, in addition to airway clearance techniques. These additional therapies are not covered in this overview. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 November 2018. Study characteristics This overview included six Cochrane Reviews. One review compared any type of chest physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy, PEP therapy, high‐pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage, exercise, vibrating (oscillating) devices) with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone. The remaining five reviews included head‐to‐head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques, thus these five reviews often overlapped with each other. Key results In this overview, we found moderate evidence that PEP therapy and vibrating (oscillating) devices have a similar effect on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) after six months of treatment. We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for all other comparisons in terms of FEV 1  because the quality of evidence is currently lacking. Likewise, we are unable to draw any definitive conclusions for other outcome measures such as individual preference and quality of life. Harms, such as acid reflux, collapsed lungs, coughing up blood, or decreased oxygen, were rarely mentioned in the original trials. There is a lack of evidence to determine if any particular airway clearance therapy is riskier than the other therapies. Quality of the evidence All of the reviews were considered to be well‐conducted. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report enough detailed information to allow us to properly determine trial quality. Many trials did not report enough information on outcome measures; it is unclear how this missing information would influence the results. We graded the evidence for lung function when PEP was compared to vibrating (oscillating) devices as moderate, but the evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes, such as individual preference and quality of life was of low or very low quality. More long‐term, high‐quality trials (where participants are put into groups at random) which compare different airway clearance techniques among people with CF are needed.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Systematic Reviews as Topic; Chest Wall Oscillation [instrumentation, methods]; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Drainage [methods]; Humans; Positive‐Pressure Respiration [*methods]; Respiratory Therapy [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD011231.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011231.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Objectives To systematically evaluate evidence from published Cochrane Reviews of clinical trials to summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of rehabilitation interventions for people with MS (pwMS), to improve patient outcomes, and to highlight current gaps in knowledge. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to December 2017, to identify Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effectiveness of organised rehabilitation interventions for pwMS. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included reviews, using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R‐AMSTAR) tool, and the quality of the evidence for reported outcomes, using the GRADE framework. Main results Overall, we included 15 reviews published in the Cochrane Library, comprising 164 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four controlled clinical trials, with a total of 10,396 participants. The included reviews evaluated a wide range of rehabilitation interventions, including: physical activity and exercise therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), whole‐body vibration, occupational therapy, cognitive and psychological interventions, nutritional and dietary supplements, vocational rehabilitation, information provision, telerehabilitation, and interventions for the management of spasticity. We assessed all reviews to be of high to moderate methodological quality, based on R‐AMSTAR criteria. Moderate‐quality evidence suggested that physical therapeutic modalities (exercise and physical activities) improved functional outcomes (mobility, muscular strength), reduced impairment (fatigue), and improved participation (quality of life). Moderate‐quality evidence suggested that inpatient or outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes led to longer‐term gains at the levels of activity and participation, and interventions that provided information improved patient knowledge. Low‐qualitty evidence suggested that neuropsychological interventions, symptom‐management programmes (spasticity), whole body vibration, and telerehabilitation improved some patient outcomes. Evidence for other rehabilitation modalities was inconclusive, due to lack of robust studies. Authors' conclusions The evidence suggests that regular specialist evaluation and follow‐up to assess the needs of patients with all types of MS for appropriate rehabilitation interventions may be of benefit, although the certainty of evidence varies across the different types of interventions evaluated by the reviews. Structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes and physical therapy (exercise or physical activities) can improve functional outcomes (mobility, muscle strength, aerobic capacity), and quality of life. Overall, the evidence for many rehabilitation interventions should be interpreted cautiously, as the majority of included reviews did not include data from current studies. More studies, with appropriate design, which report the type and intensity of modalities and their cost‐effectiveness are needed to address the current gaps in knowledge. Plain language summary Rehabilitation for persons with multiple sclerosis Review questions Do people with multiple sclerosis (MS), who participate in rehabilitation programmes, improve in their functional activities, disability, and quality of life compared with those who receive no rehabilitation treatment, placebo, or different types of interventions? Background MS is a complex condition, which requires comprehensive, long‐term management. Rehabilitation programmes aim to improve function, well‐being, and quality of life for people with MS. Currently, a wide variety of rehabilitation therapies are used to treat MS. Published literature, including Cochrane Reviews, that evaluates these interventions, has grown. To guide clinicians, this review assessed current Cochrane Reviews, and provides an overview of the effectiveness of rehabilitation therapies used to treat people with MS. Study characteristics We searched for all published Cochrane Reviews of MS clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions compared with various control groups (no intervention or different type of intervention). We evaluated all relevant reviews, and summarised the findings. Key results and quality of evidence We included a total of 15 Cochrane Reviews, which included 168 clinical trials, and a total of 10,396 people with MS. These good‐quality reviews evaluated a range of rehabilitation interventions, including: physical activity and exercise therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, whole‐body vibration, occupational therapy, cognitive and psychological interventions, nutritional and dietary supplements, vocational rehabilitation, information provision, telerehabilitation, and interventions for the management of spasticity. The findings showed some benefits for people with MS who participated in exercise and physical activity programmes or multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes (where the intervention is provided by a team of health professionals from different professions). They found improvements in everyday activities, function, and health‐related quality of life, compared with those who were not offered rehabilitation. Evidence for other rehabilitation modalities was limited, due to lack of good‐quality studies. More research is needed to determine whether various types of rehabilitation modalities are effective in reducing disability in people with MS.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Physical Therapy Modalities; *Systematic Reviews as Topic; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Multiple Sclerosis [*rehabilitation]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012732.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012732.pub2","Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS"
"CD012505.PUB2","Medley, N; Vogel, JP; Care, A; Alfirevic, Z","Interventions during pregnancy to prevent preterm birth: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2018","Abstract - Background Preterm birth (PTB) is a major factor contributing to global rates of neonatal death and to longer‐term health problems for surviving infants. Both the World Health Organization and the United Nations consider prevention of PTB as central to improving health care for pregnant women and newborn babies. Current preventative clinical strategies show varied efficacy in different populations of pregnant women, frustrating women and health providers alike, while researchers call for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to PTB. Objectives We aimed to summarise all evidence for interventions relevant to the prevention of PTB as reported in Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs). We intended to highlight promising interventions and to identify SRs in need of an update. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2 November 2017) with key words to capture any Cochrane SR that prespecified or reported a PTB outcome. Inclusion criteria focused on pregnant women without signs of preterm labour or ruptured amniotic membranes. We included reviews of interventions for pregnant women irrespective of their risk status. We followed standard Cochrane methods. We applied GRADE criteria to evaluate the quality of SR evidence. We assigned graphic icons to classify the effectiveness of interventions as: clear evidence of benefit; clear evidence of harm; clear evidence of no effect or equivalence; possible benefit; possible harm; or unknown benefit or harm .  We defined clear evidence of benefit and clear evidence of harm to be GRADE moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence with a confidence interval (CI) that does not cross the line of no effect. Clear evidence of no effect or equivalence is GRADE moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence with a narrow CI crossing the line of no effect. Possible benefit and possible harm refer to GRADE low‐quality evidence with a clear effect (CI does not cross the line of no effect) or GRADE moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence with a wide CI. Unknown harm or benefit refers to GRADE low‐ or very low‐quality evidence with a wide CI. Main results We included 83 SRs; 70 had outcome data. Below we highlight key results from a subset of 36 SRs of interventions intended to prevent PTB. Outcome: preterm birth Clear evidence of benefit Four SRs reported clear evidence of benefit to prevent specific populations of pregnant women from giving birth early, including midwife‐led continuity models of care versus other models of care for all women; screening for lower genital tract infections for pregnant women less than 37 weeks' gestation and without signs of labour, bleeding or infection; and zinc supplementation for pregnant women without systemic illness. Cervical cerclage showed clear benefit for women with singleton pregnancy and high risk of PTB only. Clear evidence of harm No included SR reported clear evidence of harm. No effect or equivalence For pregnant women at high risk of PTB, bedrest for women with singleton pregnancy and antibiotic prophylaxis during the second and third trimester were of no effect or equivalent to a comparator. Possible benefit Four SRs found possible benefit in: group antenatal care for all pregnant women; antibiotics for pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria; pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation for pregnant women who smoke; and vitamin D supplements alone for women without pre‐existing conditions such as diabetes. Possible harm One SR reported possible harm (increased risk of PTB) with intramuscular progesterone, but this finding is only relevant to women with multiple pregnancy and high risk of PTB. Another review found possible harm with vitamin D, calcium and other minerals for pregnant women without pre‐existing conditions. Outcome: perinatal death Clear evidence of benefit Two SRs reported clear evidence of benefit to reduce pregnant women's risk of perinatal death: midwife‐led continuity models of care for all pregnant women; and fetal and umbilical Doppler for high‐risk pregnant women. Clear evidence of harm No included SR reported clear evidence of harm. No effect or equivalence For pregnant women at high risk of PTB, antibiotic prophylaxis during the second and third trimester was of no effect or equivalent to a comparator. Possible benefit One SR reported possible benefit with cervical cerclage for women with singleton pregnancy and high risk of PTB. Possible harm One SR reported possible harm associated with a reduced schedule of antenatal visits for pregnant women at low risk of pregnancy complications; importantly, these women already received antenatal care in settings with limited resources. Outcomes: preterm birth and perinatal death Unknown benefit or harm For pregnant women at high risk of PTB for any reason including multiple pregnancy, home uterine monitoring was of unknown benefit or harm. For pregnant women at high risk due to multiple pregnancy: bedrest, prophylactic oral betamimetics, vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage were all of unknown benefit or harm. Authors' conclusions Implications for practice The overview serves as a map and guide to all current evidence relevant to PTB prevention published in the Cochrane Library. Of 70 SRs with outcome data, we identified 36 reviews of interventions with the aim of preventing PTB. Just four of these SRs had evidence of clear benefit to women, with an additional four SRs reporting possible benefit. No SR reported clear harm, which is an important finding for women and health providers alike. The overview summarises no evidence for the clinically important interventions of cervical pessary, cervical length assessment and vaginal progesterone because these Cochrane Reviews were not current. These are active areas for PTB research. The graphic icons we assigned to SR effect estimates do not constitute clinical guidance or an endorsement of specific interventions for pregnant women. It remains critical for pregnant women and their healthcare providers to carefully consider whether specific strategies to prevent PTB will be of benefit for individual women, or for specific populations of women. Implications for research Formal consensus work is needed to establish standard language for overviews of reviews and to define the limits of their interpretation. Clinicians, researchers and funders must address the lack of evidence for interventions relevant to women at high risk of PTB due to multiple pregnancy. Plain language summary Ways to help pregnant women avoid preterm birth What is the issue? Preterm birth, or being born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, is a major reason why newborns die and may also mean long‐term disability for surviving infants. There are many ways healthcare providers try to prevent women from having their babies too early. Pregnant women may be encouraged to take vitamins, reduce smoking, take medicines for infections or attend regular healthcare visits. Our overview looks at different ways (or interventions) to prevent preterm birth. We searched for relevant papers in the Cochrane Library on 2 November, 2017. Why is this important? Preterm birth is devastating and costly for women, families and health systems. We aimed to summarise relevant information for pregnant women, healthcare workers and researchers. What evidence did we find? We included 83 systematic reviews with evidence about whether or not the intervention was able to reduce pregnant women's chance of having a preterm birth or a baby death. Seventy of these reviews had information about preterm birth. We categorised the evidence we found as: clear benefit or harm; no effect; possible benefit or harm; or unknown effect. Outcome: preterm birth Clear benefit We were confident that the following interventions were able to help specific populations of pregnant women avoid giving birth early: midwife‐led continuity models of care versus other models of care for all women; screening for lower genital tract infections; and zinc supplementation for pregnant women without systemic illness. Cervical stitch (cerclage) was of benefit only for women at high risk of preterm birth and with singleton pregnancy. Clear harm We found no treatment that increased women’s chance of giving birth preterm. Possible benefit The following interventions may have helped some groups of pregnant women avoid preterm birth, but we have less confidence in these results: group antenatal care for all pregnant women; antibiotics for pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria; pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation; and vitamin D supplements alone for women without health problems. Possible harm We found two interventions that may have made things worse for some pregnant women: intramuscular progesterone for women at high risk of preterm birth with multiple pregnancy; and taking vitamin D supplements, calcium and other minerals for pregnant women without health problems. Outcome: perinatal death Clear benefit We were confident in evidence for midwife‐led continuity models of care for all pregnant women; and for fetal and umbilical Doppler for high‐risk pregnant women; these interventions appeared to reduce women's chance of experiencing baby death. Clear harm We found no intervention that increased women’s risk of baby death. Possible benefit We found a possible benefit with cervical stitch (cerclage) for women with singleton pregnancy and high risk of preterm birth. Possible harm One review reported possible harm associated with having fewer antenatal visits, even for pregnant women at low risk of pregnancy problems. The pregnant women in this review already received limited antenatal care. Outcomes: preterm birth and perinatal death Unknown benefit or harm For pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth for any reason including multiple pregnancy, home uterine monitoring was of unknown benefit or harm. For high‐risk pregnant women with multiple pregnancy: bedrest, prophylactic oral betamimetics, vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage were all of unknown benefit or harm. What does this mean? There is valuable information in the Cochrane Library relevant to women, doctors, midwives and researchers interested in preventing early birth. We have summarised the results of systematic reviews to describe how well different strategies work to prevent early birth and baby death. We organised our information in clear figures with graphic icons to represent how confident we were in the results and to point readers toward promising treatments for specific groups of pregnant women. Our overview found no up‐to‐date information in the Cochrane Library for the important treatments of cervical pessary, vaginal progesterone or cervical assessment with ultrasound. We found no high‐quality evidence relevant to women at high risk of preterm birth due to multiple pregnancy. It remains important for pregnant women and their healthcare providers to carefully consider whether specific strategies to prevent preterm birth will be of benefit for individual women, or for specific populations of women.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Systematic Reviews as Topic; Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Bed Rest; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Premature Birth [*prevention & control]; Smoking Cessation; Vitamin D [administration & dosage]; Vitamins [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD012505.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012505.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"

In low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC), the problems supplementary feeding aims to address are entangled with poverty and deprivation, the programmes are expensive and delivery is complicated. Objectives 1. To summarise the evidence from systematic reviews of supplementary feeding for food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished populations, including children under five years of age, school‐aged children, pregnant and lactating women, people with HIV or tuberculosis (or both), and older populations. 2. To describe and explore the effects of supplementary feeding given to people in these groups, and to describe the range of outcomes between reviews and range of effects in the different groups. Methods In January 2017, we searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,  MEDLINE, Embase and nine other databases. We included systematic reviews evaluating community‐based supplementary feeding, and concerning food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished populations. Two review authors independently undertook selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment. We assessed review quality using the AMSTAR tool, and used GRADEpro 'Summary of findings' tables from each review to indicate the certainty of the evidence for the main comparisons. We summarised review findings in the text and reported the data for each outcome in additional tables. We also used forest plots to display results graphically. Main results This overview included eight systematic reviews (with last search dates between May 2006 and February 2016). Seven were Cochrane Reviews evaluating interventions in pregnant women; children (aged from birth to five years) from LMIC; disadvantaged infants and young children (aged three months to five years); children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM); disadvantaged school children; adults and children who were HIV positive or with active tuberculosis (with or without HIV). One was a non‐Cochrane systematic review in older people with Alzheimer's disease. These reviews included 95 trials relevant to this overview, with the majority (74%) of participants from LMIC. The number of included participants varied between 91 and 7940 adults, and 271 and more than 12,595 children. Trials included a wide array of nutritional interventions that varied in duration, frequency and format, with micronutrients often reported as cointerventions. Follow‐up ranged from six weeks to two years; three trials investigated outcomes at four to 17 years of age. All reviews were rated as high quality (AMSTAR score between eight and 11). The GRADE certainty ratings ranged from very low to moderate for individual comparisons, with the evidence often comprising only one or two small trials, thereby resulting in many underpowered analyses (too small to detect small but important differences). The main outcome categories reported across reviews were death, anthropometry (adults and children) and other markers of nutritional status, disease‐related outcomes, neurocognitive development and psychosocial outcomes, and adverse events. Mortality data were limited and underpowered in meta‐analysis in all populations (children with MAM, in children with HIV, and in adults with tuberculosis) with the exception of balanced energy and protein supplementation in pregnancy, which may have reduced the risk of stillbirth (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.94; 5 trials, 3408 women). Supplementation in pregnancy also improved infant birth weight (mean difference (MD) 40.96 g, 95% CI 4.66 to 77.26; 11 trials, 5385 participants) and reduced risk of infants born small‐for‐gestational age (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; 7 trials, 4408 participants). These effects did not translate into demonstrable long‐term benefits for children in terms of growth and neurocognitive development in the one to two trials reporting on longer‐term outcomes. In one study (505 participants), high‐protein supplementation was associated with increased risk of small‐for‐gestational age babies. Effects on growth in children were mixed. In children under five years of age from LMIC, one review found that supplementary feeding had a little or no effect on child growth; however, a more recent review in a similar population found that those who received food supplementation gained an average of 0.12 kg more in weight (MD 0.12 kg, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.18; 9 trials, 1057 participants) and 0.27 cm more in height (MD 0.27 cm, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.48; 9 trials, 1463 participants) than those who were not supplemented. Supplementary food was generally more effective for younger children (younger than two years of age) and for those who were poorer or less well‐nourished. In children with MAM, the provision of specially formulated food improved their weight, weight‐for‐height z scores and other key outcomes such as recovery rate (by 29%), as well as reducing the number of participants dropping out (by 70%). In LMIC, school meals seemed to lead to small benefits for children, including improvements in weight z scores, especially in children from lower‐income countries, height z scores, cognition or intelligence quotient tests, and maths and spelling performance. Supplementary feeding in adults who were HIV positive increased the daily energy and protein intake compared to nutritional counselling alone. Supplementation led to an initial improvement in weight gain or body mass index but did not seem to confer long‐term benefit. In adults with tuberculosis, one small trial found a significant benefit on treatment completion and sputum conversion rate. There were also significant but modest benefits in terms of weight gain (up to 2.60 kg) during active tuberculosis. The one study included in the Alzheimer's disease review found that three months of daily oral nutritional supplements improved nutritional outcomes in the intervention group. There was little or no evidence regarding people's quality of life, adherence to treatment, attendance at clinic or the costs of supplementary feeding programmes. Authors' conclusions Considering the current evidence base included, supplementary food effects are modest at best, with inconsistent and limited mortality evidence. The trials reflected in the reviews mostly reported on short‐term outcomes and across the whole of the supplementation trial literature it appears important outcomes, such as quality of life and cost of programmes, are not systematically reported or summarised. Plain language summary Supplementary feeding for groups of people that are food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished What was the aim of this review? To summarise the effect of supplementary feeding on populations that were food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished. The overview authors found eight systematic reviews examining supplementary feeding in a variety of populations. Key messages Across a range of vulnerable populations, supplementary feeding programmes sometimes show modest benefit in nutritional outcomes. In a few studies examining mortality (death), effects were either small or absent, and research mostly looked at short‐term effects. What was studied in the review? Supplementary feeding means providing extra food to people or families over and above their home diet and has been used in populations that are food insecure (limited access to adequate and nutritious food) and vulnerable (including women and young children; school‐aged children; people living with diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, and Alzheimer's disease; and older people) to improve their health and quality of life. What are the main results of the review? The evidence presented here was current to January 2017. We found eight systematic reviews to include in this summary. These reviews included 95 studies (including up to 7940 adults, and more than 12,595 children in a few studies). Most of the included studies lasted from six weeks to two years, with only three studies following people for longer periods of time (up to 17 years). In these reviews, there were a wide range of different types of supplementary feeding given to vulnerable groups over different periods of time, and often in combination with vitamins or minerals. In pregnancy, we found that energy and protein supplements that were balanced (i.e. providing adequate amounts of energy and nutrients, in this case protein) may have decreased the rate of stillbirth (death or loss of a baby before or during delivery), improved infant birth weight and reduced the risk of infants born small‐for‐gestational age (infants that are smaller than expected). We observed no long‐term benefits for children in terms of growth and cognitive (intellectual) development (although very few studies reported long‐term effects). High‐protein supplements (containing protein in higher amounts) were associated with risk and harm (increased risk of small‐for‐gestational age babies). We found that the effects of supplementary feeding on growth in children were varied. In children under five years of age from low‐ and middle‐income countries, supplementary feeding had a small impact on child growth. We observed some benefits in terms of weight and height gains, especially in younger children (those younger than two years of age) and in those who were poorer or less well‐nourished (or both). Some benefit could be seen in children with moderate acute malnutrition in terms of weight gain, other growth factors and recovery rate. School meals seemed to lead to a number of small benefits in school children (including improvements in weight, height, intelligence tests, and maths and spelling performance). Supplementary feeding in adults who were HIV positive increased the daily intake of energy and protein and led to an early improvement in weight gain or body mass index (measure of whether someone is overweight or underweight), or both, but did not seem to lead to long‐term benefits (although few studies reported long‐term effects). In adults with tuberculosis (serious infectious lung disease), we observed small benefits in terms of weight gain during active tuberculosis. In Alzheimer's disease (a type of dementia), providing a daily oral nutrition supplement for three months improved nutritional outcomes (such as weight and energy intake).

Increasingly, couples are turning to assisted reproductive technology (ART) for help with conceiving and ultimately giving birth to a healthy live baby of their own. Fertility treatments are complex, and each ART cycle consists of several steps. If one of these steps is incorrectly applied, the stakes are high as conception may not occur. With this in mind, it is important that each step of the ART cycle is supported by good evidence from well‐designed studies. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on procedures and treatment options available to couples with subfertility undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. Methods Published Cochrane systematic reviews of couples undergoing ART procedures (in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection) were eligible for inclusion in the overview. We also identified Cochrane reviews in preparation, for future inclusion. The primary outcome of the overview was live birth or the composite outcome live birth or ongoing pregnancy, as reported by the included reviews. Our secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We excluded studies of intrauterine insemination and ovulation induction. We undertook selection of systematic reviews, data extraction, and quality assessment in duplicate. We assessed review quality by using the AMSTAR tool. We organised reviews by their relevance to specific stages in the ART cycle. We summarised their findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'. Main results We included 68 systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library up to May 2018. All were of high quality. These reviews identified 38 interventions that were effective (n = 23) or promising (n = 15), and they identified 19 interventions that were ineffective (n = 2) or possibly ineffective (n = 17). For 15 interventions, review authors were unable to draw conclusions owing to lack of evidence. We identified an additional 11 protocols and four titles for future inclusion in this overview. Authors' conclusions This overview provides the most up‐to‐date evidence on ART cycles from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials. Fertility treatments are costly, and the stakes are high. Using the best available evidence to optimise outcomes is best practice. Evidence from this overview could be used to develop clinical practice guidelines and protocols that can be applied in daily clinical practice to improve live birth rates and reduce rates of multiple pregnancy, cycle cancellation, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Objectives To provide a comprehensive synthesis of evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews of the benefits and harms associated with interventions for treating GDM on women and their babies. Methods We searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (5 January 2018) for reviews of treatment/management for women with GDM. Reviews of pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes were excluded. Two overview authors independently assessed reviews for inclusion, quality (AMSTAR; ROBIS), quality of evidence (GRADE), and extracted data. Main results We included 14 reviews. Of these, 10 provided relevant high‐quality and low‐risk of bias data (AMSTAR and ROBIS) from 128 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 27 comparisons, 17,984 women, 16,305 babies, and 1441 children. Evidence ranged from high‐ to very low‐quality (GRADE). Only one effective intervention was found for treating women with GDM. Effective Lifestyle versus usual care Lifestyle intervention versus usual care probably reduces large‐for‐gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71; 6 RCTs, N = 2994; GRADE moderate‐quality). Promising No evidence for any outcome for any comparison could be classified to this category. Ineffective or possibly harmful Lifestyle versus usual care Lifestyle intervention versus usual care probably increases the risk of induction of labour (IOL) suggesting possible harm (average RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.46; 4 RCTs, N = 2699; GRADE moderate‐quality). Exercise versus control Exercise intervention versus control for return to pre‐pregnancy weight suggested ineffectiveness (body mass index, BMI) MD 0.11 kg/m², 95% CI ‐1.04 to 1.26; 3 RCTs, N = 254; GRADE moderate‐quality). Insulin versus oral therapy Insulin intervention versus oral therapy probably increases the risk of IOL suggesting possible harm (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 3 RCTs, N = 348; GRADE moderate‐quality). Probably ineffective or harmful interventions Insulin versus oral therapy For insulin compared to oral therapy there is probably an increased risk of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.12; 4 RCTs, N = 1214; GRADE moderate‐quality). Inconclusive Lifestyle versus usual care The evidence for childhood adiposity kg/m² (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 RCTs, N = 767; GRADE moderate‐quality) and hypoglycaemia was inconclusive (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.52; 6 RCTs, N = 3000; GRADE moderate‐quality). Exercise versus control The evidence for caesarean section (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 5 RCTs, N = 316; GRADE moderate quality) and perinatal death or serious morbidity composite was inconclusive (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.61; 2 RCTs, N = 169; GRADE moderate‐quality). Insulin versus oral therapy The evidence for the following outcomes was inconclusive: pre‐eclampsia (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; 10 RCTs, N = 2060), caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 17 RCTs, N = 1988), large‐for‐gestational age (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; 13 RCTs, N = 2352), and perinatal death or serious morbidity composite (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.26; 2 RCTs, N = 760). GRADE assessment was moderate‐quality for these outcomes. Insulin versus diet The evidence for perinatal mortality was inconclusive (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.33; 4 RCTs, N = 1137; GRADE moderate‐quality).

The evidence ranged from moderate‐, low‐ and very low‐quality. Authors' conclusions Currently there is insufficient high‐quality evidence about the effects on health outcomes of relevance for women with GDM and their babies for many of the comparisons in this overview comparing treatment interventions for women with GDM. Lifestyle changes (including as a minimum healthy eating, physical activity and self‐monitoring of blood sugar levels) was the only intervention that showed possible health improvements for women and their babies. Lifestyle interventions may result in fewer babies being large. Conversely, in terms of harms, lifestyle interventions may also increase the number of inductions. Taking insulin was also associated with an increase in hypertensive disorders, when compared to oral therapy. There was very limited information on long‐term health and health services costs. Further high‐quality research is needed. Plain language summary Treatments to improve pregnancy outcomes for women who develop diabetes during pregnancy: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews What is the issue? The aim of this Cochrane overview was to provide a summary of the effects of interventions for women who develop diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus, GDM) and the effects on women's health and the health of their babies. We assessed all relevant Cochrane Reviews (date of last search: January 2018). Why is this important? GDM can occur in mid‐to‐late pregnancy. High blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) possibly have negative effects on both the woman and her baby's health in the short‐ and long‐term. For women, GDM can mean an increased risk of developing high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre‐eclampsia). Women with GDM also have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke later in life. Babies born to mothers with GDM are at increased risk of being large, having low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) after birth, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). As these babies become children, they are at higher risk of being overweight and developing type 2 diabetes. Several Cochrane Reviews have assessed different interventions for women with GDM. This overview brings these reviews together. We looked at diet, exercise, drugs, supplements, lifestyle changes, and ways GDM is managed or responded to by the healthcare team. What evidence did we find? We found 14 Cochrane systematic reviews and included 10 reviews covering 128 studies in our analysis, which included a total of 17,984 women, and their babies. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high. We looked at: •  Dietary interventions  (including change to low or moderate glycaemic index (GI) diet, calorie restrictions, low carbohydrate diet, high complex carbohydrate diet, high saturated fat diet, high fibre diet, soy‐protein enriched diet, etc.) We found there were not enough data on any one dietary intervention to be able to say whether it helped or not. •  Exercise programmes  (including brisk walking, cycling, resistance circuit‐type training, instruction on active lifestyle, home‐based exercise programme, 6‐week or 10‐week exercise programme, yoga, etc.) Similarly, there were not enough data on any specific exercise regimen to say if it helped or not. •  Taking insulin or other drugs to control diabetes  (including insulin and oral glucose lowering drugs). Insulin probably increases the risk of high blood pressure and its problems in pregnancy (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy) when compared to oral therapy (moderate‐quality evidence). •  Supplements  (myo‐inositol given as a water‐soluble powder or capsule). We found there was not enough data to be able to say if myo‐inositol was helpful or not. •  Lifestyle changes  which combine two or more interventions such as: healthy eating, exercise, education, mindfulness eating (focusing the mind on eating), yoga, relaxation, etc. Lifestyle interventions may be associated with fewer babies being born large (moderate‐quality evidence) but may result in an increase in inductions of labour (moderate‐quality evidence). •  Management strategies  (including early birth, methods of blood glucose monitoring). We found little data for strategies which included planned induction of labour or planned birth by caesarean section, and there was no clear difference in outcomes among these care plans. Similarly, we found no clear difference among outcomes for different methods of blood glucose monitoring. What does this mean? There are limited data on the various interventions. Lifestyle changes (including as a minimum healthy eating, physical activity, and self‐monitoring of blood sugar levels) was the only intervention that showed possible health improvements for women and their babies. Lifestyle interventions may result in fewer babies being large. Conversely, in terms of harms, lifestyle interventions may also increase the number of inductions. Taking insulin was also associated with an increase in hypertensive disorders, when compared to oral therapy. There was very limited information on long‐term health and health services costs. Women may wish to discuss lifestyle changes around their individual needs with their health professional. Further high‐quality research is needed.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Review Literature as Topic; Diabetes, Gestational [*therapy]; Exercise; Female; Humans; Hypertension [chemically induced]; Hypoglycemic Agents [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Infant, Newborn; Insulin [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Labor, Induced; Life Style; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular [chemically induced]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012327.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012327.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"

SCD can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long‐term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications. Objectives To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD. Methods We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment. Main results We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short‐ or long‐term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease‐modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long‐term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals). In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low‐quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event. Short‐term RBC transfusion versus standard care  (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low‐ to low‐quality evidence)  In people undergoing low‐ to medium‐risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low‐quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very‐low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD‐related or transfusion‐related complications (very‐low quality evidence). Long‐term RBC transfusion versus standard care  (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence)  In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long‐term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate‐quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low‐quality evidence). Long‐term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low‐quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low‐quality evidence). In children and adolescents already receiving long‐term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long‐term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low‐quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very‐low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no difference in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low‐quality evidence). Long‐term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications  (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low‐ to low‐quality evidence)  In pregnant women, long‐term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low‐quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD‐related complications or transfusion reactions (very‐low quality evidence). RBC transfusion versus disease‐modifying agents (hydroxyurea)  (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low‐ to low‐quality evidence)  For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease‐modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very‐low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low‐quality evidence). Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very‐low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low‐quality evidence). Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy  (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low‐quality evidence)  In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD‐related or transfusion‐related complications (very‐low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions This overview provides support from two high‐quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population. This overview highlights the lack of high‐quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient‐relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD‐related serious adverse events and quality of life. Plain language summary An overview of Cochrane Reviews on red blood cell transfusions to treat or prevent sickle cell disease‐related complications Review question To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Background SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the RBCs, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal RBCs are flexible and disc‐shaped, but in SCD they can become rigid and crescent shaped. Sickled cells are not only less flexible than healthy RBCs, they are also stickier. This can lead to the blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal RBCs are more fragile and break apart, which leads to fewer of them, known as anaemia. Overview characteristics We searched for Cochrane Reviews that analysed the data from randomised controlled trials (RCT; experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups), which looked at the effectiveness of RBC transfusions to prevent or treat SCD complications. This overview summarises the results of these reviews. Key results 15 reviews met the inclusion criteria for this overview. However, only four reviews (which included nine RCTs and 1052 participants) looked at the effects of RBCtransfusion and had results that could be reported. In the four reviews there was no difference in the risk of death with any comparison. We found that long‐term RBC transfusions compared to standard care, probably decrease the risk of stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasound (high blood flow to the brain) or a previous silent stroke (a stroke with no outward symptoms and where a person is typically unaware they have suffered a stroke)) and may also decrease their risk of painful crisis and acute chest syndrome. Red blood cell transfusions may also decrease the risk of silent stroke in children with abnormal TCD ultrasound when compared to standard care. We found there was a lack of evidence for treating adults with SCD‐related complications and that important outcomes, including quality of life were often not measured or reported. Quality of the reviews and evidence within reviews All reviews included in this review were of high quality and met Cochrane standards for systematic reviews. However, the quality of the trials included in the reviews was variable across the trials and in relation to the outcomes. The quality of the evidence within the trials was downgraded because trials had a high risk of bias, outcomes had imprecise measurements and much of the evidence applied only to children with HbSS disease. People with SCD are living longer and we need more high‐quality evidence on treating adults with SCD; as well as on the best treatment options, including the role of RBC transfusions, to treat SCD complications. We also need to improve and standardise the reporting of outcomes across trials.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Erythrocyte Transfusion; *Systematic Reviews as Topic; Adolescent; Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications, *therapy]; Antisickling Agents [*therapeutic use]; Child; Humans; Hydroxyurea [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke [*prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD012082.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012082.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

As there are diverse risk factors and aetiologies, no one strategy will prevent cerebral palsy. Therefore, there is a need to systematically consider all potentially relevant interventions for prevention. Objectives Primary To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews regarding effects of neonatal interventions for preventing cerebral palsy (reducing cerebral palsy risk). Secondary To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews regarding effects of neonatal interventions that may increase cerebral palsy risk. Methods We searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (27 November 2016) for reviews of neonatal interventions reporting on cerebral palsy. Two review authors assessed reviews for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed review quality (using AMSTAR and ROBIS) and quality of the evidence (using the GRADE approach). Reviews were organised by topic; findings were summarised in text and were tabulated. Interventions were categorised as effective (high‐quality evidence of effectiveness); possibly effective (moderate‐quality evidence of effectiveness); ineffective (high‐quality evidence of harm); probably ineffective (moderate‐quality evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness); and no conclusions possible (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). Main results Forty‐three Cochrane Reviews were included. A further 102 reviews pre‐specified the outcome cerebral palsy, but none of the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported this outcome. Included reviews were generally of high quality and had low risk of bias, as determined by AMSTAR and ROBIS. These reviews involved 454 RCTs; data for cerebral palsy were available from 96 (21%) RCTs involving 15,885 children. Review authors considered interventions for neonates with perinatal asphyxia or with evidence of neonatal encephalopathy (3); interventions for neonates born preterm and/or at low or very low birthweight (33); and interventions for other specific groups of 'at risk' neonates (7). Quality of evidence (GRADE) ranged from very low to high. Interventions for neonates with perinatal asphyxia or with evidence of neonatal encephalopathy Effective interventions: high‐quality evidence of effectiveness Researchers found a reduction in cerebral palsy following therapeutic hypothermia versus standard care for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.82; seven trials; 881 children). No conclusions possible: very low‐quality evidence One review observed no clear differences in cerebral palsy following therapeutic hypothermia versus standard care. Interventions for neonates born preterm and/or at low or very low birthweight Possibly effective interventions: moderate‐quality evidence of effectiveness Researchers found a reduction in cerebral palsy with prophylactic methylxanthines (caffeine) versus placebo for endotracheal extubation in preterm infants (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92; one trial; 644 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate‐quality evidence of harm Researchers reported an increase in cerebral palsy (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.98; 12 trials; 1452 children) and cerebral palsy in assessed survivors (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.00; 12 trials; 959 children) following early (at less than eight days of age) postnatal corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Probably ineffective interventions: moderate‐quality evidence of lack of effectiveness Trial results showed no clear differences in cerebral palsy following ethamsylate versus placebo for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm or very low birthweight infants (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.00; three trials, 532 children); volume expansion versus no treatment (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; one trial; 604 children); gelatin versus fresh frozen plasma (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.69; one trial, 399 children) for prevention of morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants; prophylactic indomethacin versus placebo for preventing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.40; four trials; 1372 children); synthetic surfactant versus placebo for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; five trials; 1557 children); or prophylactic phototherapy versus standard care (starting phototherapy when serum bilirubin reached a pre‐specified level) for preventing jaundice in preterm or low birthweight infants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.85; two trials; 756 children). No conclusions possible: low‐ to very low‐quality evidence No clear differences in cerebral palsy were observed with interventions assessed in 21 reviews. Interventions for other specific groups of 'at risk' neonates No conclusions possible: low‐ to very low‐quality evidence Review authors observed no clear differences in cerebral palsy with interventions assessed in five reviews. Authors' conclusions This overview summarises evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews regarding effects of neonatal interventions on cerebral palsy, and can be used by researchers, funding bodies, policy makers, clinicians, and consumers to aid decision‐making and evidence translation. To formally assess other benefits and/or harms of included interventions, including impact on risk factors for cerebral palsy, review of the included Reviews is recommended. Therapeutic hypothermia versus standard care for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy can prevent cerebral palsy, and prophylactic methylxanthines (caffeine) versus placebo for endotracheal extubation in preterm infants may reduce cerebral palsy risk. Early (at less than eight days of age) postnatal corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants may increase cerebral palsy risk. Cerebral palsy is rarely identified at birth, has diverse risk factors and aetiologies, and is diagnosed in approximately one in 500 children. To date, only a small proportion of Cochrane Systematic Reviews assessing neonatal interventions have been able to report on this outcome. There is an urgent need for long‐term follow‐up of RCTs of such interventions addressing risk factors for cerebral palsy (through strategies such as data linkage with registries) and for consideration of the use of relatively new interim assessments (including the General Movements Assessment). Such RCTs must be rigorous in their design and must aim for consistency in cerebral palsy outcome measurement and reporting to facilitate pooling of data and thus to maximise research efforts focused on prevention. Plain language summary Interventions for babies from birth to one month of life for preventing cerebral palsy: an overview of Cochrane Systematic Reviews What is the issue? 'Cerebral palsy' is a term that includes a group of conditions affecting people's ability to move; it is the most common physical disability in childhood. Cerebral palsy is usually due to events before, during, or after childbirth that lead to injury to babies' developing brains. No single cause of cerebral palsy is known. For many children, the cause of cerebral palsy is unclear, but many risk factors are known. The biggest risk factor is preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy). Other risk factors during the neonatal period (birth to one month of life) include prolonged loss of oxygen during birth; brain injury; strokes or seizures; disorders of the heart, blood vessels, airways, and lungs; prolonged mechanical assistance for breathing; some infections; jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and eyes due to excess bilirubin in the blood); and some syndromes or abnormalities of chromosomes (structures that hold genes). Why is this important? As there are different risk factors for and causes of cerebral palsy, it is likely that different interventions may be needed to prevent cerebral palsy by reducing risk factors. This overview summarises evidence about preventing cerebral palsy that has been presented in Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions during the neonatal period. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence on 27 November 2016, and identified 43 Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions during the neonatal period that reported some information on cerebral palsy. These Reviews were all of moderate to high quality, but the quality of the evidence about cerebral palsy ranged from very low to high. Three Reviews assessed interventions for newborn babies who may have had a lack of oxygen at or around the time of birth; 33 Reviews assessed interventions for babies born preterm or at low birthweight; and seven Reviews assessed interventions for other groups of newborn babies at risk of injury to their brains (such as newborn babies with low blood sugar at birth). We found that one intervention was effective for cerebral palsy prevention. Newborn babies who may have had a lack of oxygen at or around the time of birth who had induced hypothermia (cooling of their body or just their brain) were less likely to develop cerebral palsy than babies who did not receive hypothermia (seven trials; 881 children; high‐quality evidence). We found that one intervention was possibly effective for cerebral palsy prevention. Preterm newborns who received methylxanthines (caffeine) when weaning from machine‐assisted breathing (extubation from mechanical ventilation) was planned were less likely to develop cerebral palsy than babies who received a placebo (one trial; 644 children; moderate‐quality evidence). We found one intervention that was probably ineffective and may cause harm: Preterm newborns who received early (at less than eight days of age) corticosteroids to prevent chronic lung disease were more likely to develop cerebral palsy than babies who received a placebo (12 trials; 959 children; moderate‐quality evidence). We found that five other interventions were probably ineffective (did not prevent or increased the chance of cerebral palsy) (moderate‐quality evidence). Review authors did not find enough evidence to say whether the other interventions prevented, increased, or had no impact on cerebral palsy (low‐ or very low‐quality evidence). What does this mean? This overview identified one intervention that was effective in preventing cerebral palsy (induced hypothermia for newborn babies who may have had a lack of oxygen), one that was possibly effective for preventing cerebral palsy (caffeine for preterm babies weaning from machine‐assisted breathing), one that appeared to cause harm (corticosteroids at less than eight days of age for preterm babies to prevent chronic lung disease), and five that did not appear to make a difference. For the other interventions assessed, there was not enough evidence to allow conclusions. It is important that additional good quality trials assessing interventions that might impact cerebral palsy risk factors conduct long‐term follow‐up to measure the impact of these interventions. We identified over 100 other Cochrane Reviews that may in the future provide information on interventions during the neonatal period for preventing cerebral palsy if they include long‐term follow‐up.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Asphyxia Neonatorum [therapy]; Brain Diseases [therapy]; Cerebral Palsy [*prevention & control]; Humans; Hypothermia, Induced; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012409.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012409.pub2","Neonatal"

Due to the large number of surgical procedures conducted annually, the costs of these SSIs can be considerable in financial and social terms. Many interventions are used with the aim of reducing the risk of SSI in people undergoing surgery. These interventions can be broadly delivered at three stages: preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively. The intraoperative interventions are largely focused on decontamination of skin using soap and antiseptics; the use of barriers to prevent movement of micro‐organisms into incisions; and optimising the patient's own bodily functions to promote best recovery. Both decontamination and barrier methods can be aimed at people undergoing surgery and operating staff. Other interventions focused on SSI prevention may be aimed at the surgical environment and include methods of theatre cleansing and approaches to managing theatre traffic. Objectives To present an overview of Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of interventions, delivered during the intraoperative period, aimed at preventing SSIs in all populations undergoing surgery in an operating theatre. Methods Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting the effectiveness of interventions delivered during the intraoperative period in terms of SSI prevention were eligible for inclusion in this overview. We also identified Cochrane protocols and title registrations for future inclusion into the overview. We searched the Cochrane Library on 01 July 2017. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and 'Risk of bias' and certainty assessment. We used the ROBIS (risk of bias in systematic reviews) tool to assess the quality of included reviews, and we used GRADE methods to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We summarised the characteristics of included reviews in the text and in additional tables. Main results We included 32 Cochrane Reviews in this overview: we judged 30 reviews as being at low risk of bias and two at unclear risk of bias. Thirteen reviews had not been updated in the past three years. Two reviews had no relevant data to extract. We extracted data from 30 reviews with 349 included trials, totaling 73,053 participants. Interventions assessed included gloving, use of disposable face masks, patient oxygenation protocols, use of skin antiseptics for hand washing and patient skin preparation, vaginal preparation, microbial sealants, methods of surgical incision, antibiotic prophylaxis and methods of skin closure. Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence for outcomes was low or very low. Of the 77 comparisons providing evidence for the outcome of SSI, seven provided high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence, 39 provided low‐certainty evidence and 31 very low‐certainty evidence. Of the nine comparisons that provided evidence for the outcome of mortality, five provided low‐certainty evidence and four very low‐certainty evidence. There is high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence for the following outcomes for these intraoperative interventions. (1) Prophylactic intravenous antibiotics administered before caesarean incision reduce SSI risk compared with administration after cord clamping (10 trials, 5041 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.81; high‐certainty evidence ‐ assessed by review authors). (2) Preoperative antibiotics reduce SSI risk compared with placebo after breast cancer surgery (6 trials, 1708 participants; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98; high‐certainty evidence ‐ assessed by overview authors). (3) Antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduce SSI risk in caesarean sections compared with no antibiotics (82 relevant trials, 14,407 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.46; moderate‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias ‐ assessed by review authors). (4) Antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduces SSI risk for hernia repair compared with placebo or no treatment (17 trials, 7843 participants; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.84; moderate‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias ‐ assessed by overview authors); (5) There is currently no clear difference in the risk of SSI between iodine‐impregnated adhesive drapes compared with no adhesive drapes (2 trials, 1113 participants; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.60; moderate‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for imprecision ‐ assessed by review authors); (6) There is currently no clear difference in SSI risk between short‐term compared with long‐term duration antibiotics in colorectal surgery (7 trials; 1484 participants; RR 1.05 95% CI 0.78 to 1.40; moderate‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for imprecision ‐ assessed by overview authors). There was only one comparison showing negative effects associated with the intervention: adhesive drapes increase the risk of SSI compared with no drapes (5 trials; 3082 participants; RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.48; high‐certainty evidence ‐ rated by review authors). Authors' conclusions This overview provides the most up‐to‐date evidence on use of intraoperative treatments for the prevention of SSIs from all currently published Cochrane Reviews. There is evidence that some interventions are useful in reducing SSI risk for people undergoing surgery, such as antibiotic prophylaxis for caesarean section and hernia repair, and also the timing of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics administered before caesarean incision. Also, there is evidence that adhesive drapes increase SSI risk. Evidence for the many other treatment choices is largely of low or very low certainty and no quality‐of‐life or cost‐effectiveness data were reported. Future trials should elucidate the relative effects of some treatments. These studies should focus on increasing participant numbers, using robust methodology and being of sufficient duration to adequately assess SSI. Assessment of other outcomes such as mortality might also be investigated as part of non‐experimental prospective follow‐up of people with SSI of different severity, so the risk of death for different subgroups can be better understood. Plain language summary Overview of Cochrane Reviews of interventions used during surgery for preventing surgical site infection What is the aim of this overview of reviews? To identify and summarise all evidence from Cochrane Reviews on interventions to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) that are delivered while surgery is taking place (during the intraoperative period). Key messages We cannot be certain about the effectiveness in preventing SSI of the majority of intraoperative interventions, as we judged the certainty of the evidence to be generally low or very low. In some circumstances (listed below), antibiotics were effective for the prevention of SSI. There is no high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence for the relative effects of intraoperative interventions on mortality, and no data at all for quality of life or costs. For these reasons, we cannot be certain whether these antibiotics, which are effective at preventing SSI, have any negative effects on mortality or quality of life. Larger trials with appropriate methods are needed to measure the outcomes that are important to both patients and health professionals. What was studied in the overview? If bacteria get into a surgical cut during surgery, this can result in a wound infection commonly called an SSI. SSIs are one of the most common forms of healthcare‐associated infections, with around 1 in 20 surgical patients developing an SSI in hospital. SSIs can also develop after people have left hospital. SSIs can result in delayed wound healing, increased hospital stays, increased use of antibiotics, unnecessary pain and, in extreme cases, death. Their prevention is therefore a key aim for health services. Many interventions are used to reduce the risk of SSI in people having surgery. These interventions can be delivered at three stages: before, during and after the operation. It is therefore important to identify interventions that can reduce the incidence of SSIs. This overview focuses only on interventions delivered during surgery. What are the main results of the overview? In July 2017 we searched for Cochrane Reviews involving interventions for preventing SSIs during surgery. We found a total of 32 Cochrane Reviews that could be included in this overview. Two reviews had no relevant data to extract so we extracted data from 30 reviews with 349 included trials, totaling 73,053 participants. Interventions assessed included use of disposable face masks and surgical gloves, the use of oxygen during surgery, antiseptics for hand washing, patient skin preparation and cleaning the vagina before caesarean section, methods of surgical incision and skin closure and use of antibiotics to prevent infection. Evidence of at least moderate certainty indicates that the following interventions reduce SSI risk: (1) antibiotics administered via drip before caesarean incision reduce SSI risk compared with administration after cord clamping (high‐certainty evidence); (2) giving antibiotics before surgery reduces SSI risk compared with placebo after breast cancer surgery (high‐certainty evidence); (3) antibiotics used to prevent wound infections probably reduce SSIs for caesarean section compared with no antibiotics (moderate‐certainty evidence); (4) antibiotics used to prevent wound infections probably reduce SSI risk for hernia repair compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate‐certainty evidence); (5) iodine‐impregnated adhesive drapes probably make no difference to SSI risk compared with no adhesive drapes (moderate‐certainty evidence); (6) there is probably no difference in SSI risk when antibiotics are given in the short‐term compared to the long‐term during colorectal surgery (moderate‐certainty evidence). One comparison showed that adhesive drapes increase the SSI risk compared with no drapes (high‐certainty evidence). Overall, we judged the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes (SSIs and death) to be low or very low. Clinicians can use the evidence summarised in this overview to choose the best intervention for people having surgery. However, many of the comparisons were supported by low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence and so require further evidence to support future decision making. This overview can also be used by policymakers in developing local and regional protocols or guidelines and can reveal knowledge gaps for future research. How up to date is this overview? We searched for reviews that had been published up to July 2017. Of the 32 reviews included in this overview, 13 reviews had not been updated in the past three years.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Humans; Intraoperative Care [*methods]; Review Literature as Topic; Surgical Wound Infection [*prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD012653.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012653.pub2","Wounds"

Despite increased utilisation of opioids, the safety and efficacy of long‐term use of these compounds for chronic non‐cancer pain (CNCP) remains controversial. This overview of Cochrane Reviews complements the overview entitled 'High‐dose opioids for chronic non‐cancer pain: an overview of Cochrane Reviews'. Objectives To provide an overview of the occurrence and nature of adverse events associated with any opioid agent (any dose, frequency, or route of administration) used on a medium‐ or long‐term basis for the treatment of CNCP in adults. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library) Issue 3, 2017 on 8 March 2017 to identify all Cochrane Reviews of studies of medium‐ or long‐term opioid use (2 weeks or more) for CNCP in adults aged 18 and over. We assessed the quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR criteria (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) as adapted for Cochrane Overviews. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the outcomes using the GRADE framework. Main results We included a total of 16 reviews in our overview, of which 14 presented unique quantitative data. These 14 Cochrane Reviews investigated 14 different opioid agents that were administered for time periods of two weeks or longer. The longest study was 13 months in duration, with most in the 6‐ to 16‐week range. The quality of the included reviews was high using AMSTAR criteria, with 11 reviews meeting all 10 criteria, and 5 of the reviews meeting 9 out of 10, not scoring a point for either duplicate study selection and data extraction, or searching for articles irrespective of language and publication type. The quality of the evidence for the generic adverse event outcomes according to GRADE ranged from very low to moderate, with risk of bias and imprecision being identified for the following generic adverse event outcomes: any adverse event, any serious adverse event, and withdrawals due to adverse events. A GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence for specific adverse events led to a downgrading to very low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. We calculated the equivalent milligrams of morphine per 24 hours for each opioid studied (buprenorphine, codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, levorphanol, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, tilidine, and tramadol). In the 14 Cochrane Reviews providing unique quantitative data, there were 61 studies with a total of 18,679 randomised participants; 12 of these studies had a cross‐over design with two to four arms and a total of 796 participants. Based on the 14 selected Cochrane Reviews, there was a significantly increased risk of experiencing any adverse event with opioids compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.66) as well as with opioids compared to a non‐opioid active pharmacological comparator, with a similar risk ratio (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33). There was also a significantly increased risk of experiencing a serious adverse event with opioids compared to placebo (RR 2.75, 95% CI 2.06 to 3.67). Furthermore, we found significantly increased risk ratios with opioids compared to placebo for a number of specific adverse events: constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, hot flushes, increased sweating, nausea, pruritus, and vomiting. There was no data on any of the following prespecified adverse events of interest in any of the included reviews in this overview of Cochrane Reviews: addiction, cognitive dysfunction, depressive symptoms or mood disturbances, hypogonadism or other endocrine dysfunction, respiratory depression, sexual dysfunction, and sleep apnoea or sleep‐disordered breathing. We found no data for adverse events analysed by sex or ethnicity. Authors' conclusions A number of adverse events, including serious adverse events, are associated with the medium‐ and long‐term use of opioids for CNCP. The absolute event rate for any adverse event with opioids in trials using a placebo as comparison was 78%, with an absolute event rate of 7.5% for any serious adverse event. Based on the adverse events identified, clinically relevant benefit would need to be clearly demonstrated before long‐term use could be considered in people with CNCP in clinical practice. A number of adverse events that we would have expected to occur with opioid use were not reported in the included Cochrane Reviews. Going forward, we recommend more rigorous identification and reporting of all adverse events in randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews on opioid therapy. The absence of data for many adverse events represents a serious limitation of the evidence on opioids. We also recommend extending study follow‐up, as a latency of onset may exist for some adverse events. Plain language summary Side effects of opioid drugs when used to treat chronic non‐cancer pain in the medium‐ or long‐term Bottom line There is good‐quality evidence showing that side effects can occur in people with chronic non‐cancer pain who use opioid medicines for longer than two weeks. Background Opioids are a type of pain medicine related to opium. We conducted an overview of Cochrane Reviews, which are a type of scientific paper, to learn what these papers said about the side effects of opioid drugs. We were interested in the medium‐ and long‐term side effects with this treatment for pain in adults who use opioid medicines who have chronic pain that is not due to cancer. We studied opioid medications compared to pills that do not contain any medicine (placebos) and opioid medications compared to other treatments. Key results In March 2017, we found 16 Cochrane Reviews of 14 different opioid medicines, including codeine, morphine, and oxycodone. These papers included 61 studies with more than 18,000 participants. We found that people who take opioids have a higher risk of having any side effect, such as constipation, dizziness, and nausea, as well as having a serious side effect. We did not find any information in the Cochrane Reviews about many of the known and sometimes serious side effects of opioids, such as addiction, depression, and sleep problems. Quality of the reviews and the evidence We rated the quality of the included reviews out of 10 points. As all of the reviews scored 9 or 10 out of 10, we are confident that the quality of the included reviews is very good. We also rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high; these ratings showed how sure we could be about our results for the side effects of opioids. Very low‐quality evidence meant that we are very unsure about the results. High‐quality evidence meant that we are very sure of the results. All of our ratings were between very low and moderate.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Analgesics, Opioid [administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Chronic Pain [*drug therapy]; Humans; Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic [statistics & numerical data]; Review Literature as Topic; Time Factors","10.1002/14651858.CD012509.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012509.pub2","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

Methods We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ‐Evidence up to 17 December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well‐conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of delivery arrangements on patient outcomes (health and health behaviours), the quality or utilisation of healthcare services, resource use, healthcare provider outcomes (such as sick leave), or social outcomes (such as poverty or employment) and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the findings.

We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence), and assessments of the relevance of findings to low‐income countries. Main results We identified 7272 systematic reviews and included 51 of them in this overview. We judged 6 of the 51 reviews to have important methodological limitations and the other 45 to have only minor limitations. We grouped delivery arrangements into eight categories. Some reviews provided more than one comparison and were in more than one category. Across these categories, the following intervention were effective; that is, they have desirable effects on at least one outcome with moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of undesirable effects. Who receives care and when : queuing strategies and antenatal care to groups of mothers. Who provides care : lay health workers for caring for people with hypertension, lay health workers to deliver care for mothers and children or infectious diseases, lay health workers to deliver community‐based neonatal care packages, midlevel health professionals for abortion care, social support to pregnant women at risk, midwife‐led care for childbearing women, non‐specialist providers in mental health and neurology, and physician‐nurse substitution. Coordination of care : hospital clinical pathways, case management for people living with HIV and AIDS, interactive communication between primary care doctors and specialists, hospital discharge planning, adding a service to an existing service and integrating delivery models, referral from primary to secondary care, physician‐led versus nurse‐led triage in emergency departments, and team midwifery. Where care is provided : high‐volume institutions, home‐based care (with or without multidisciplinary team) for people living with HIV and AIDS, home‐based management of malaria, home care for children with acute physical conditions, community‐based interventions for childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia, out‐of‐facility HIV and reproductive health services for youth, and decentralised HIV care. Information and communication technology : mobile phone messaging for patients with long‐term illnesses, mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments, mobile phone messaging to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy, women carrying their own case notes in pregnancy, interventions to improve childhood vaccination. Quality and safety systems : decision support with clinical information systems for people living with HIV/AIDS. Complex interventions  (cutting across delivery categories and other health system arrangements): emergency obstetric referral interventions. Authors' conclusions A wide range of strategies have been evaluated for improving delivery arrangements in low‐income countries, using sound systematic review methods in both Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews. These reviews have assessed a range of outcomes. Most of the available evidence focuses on who provides care, where care is provided and coordination of care. For all the main categories of delivery arrangements, we identified gaps in primary research related to uncertainty about the applicability of the evidence to low‐income countries, low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence or a lack of studies. Plain language summary Effects of delivery arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries What is the aim of this overview? The aim of this Cochrane Overview is to provide a broad summary of what is known about the effects of delivery arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries. This overview is based on 51 systematic reviews. These systematic reviews searched for studies that evaluated different types of delivery arrangements. The reviews included a total of 850 studies. This overview is one of a series of four Cochrane Overviews that evaluate health system arrangements. What was studied in the overview? Delivery arrangements include changes in who receives care and when, who provides care, the working conditions of those who provide care, coordination of care amongst different health care providers, where care is provided, the use of information and communication technology to deliver care, and quality and safety systems. How services are delivered can have impacts on the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of health systems. This overview can help policymakers and other stakeholders to identify evidence‐informed strategies to improve the delivery of services. What are the main results of the overview? When focusing only on evidence assessed as high to moderate certainty, the overview points to a number of delivery arrangements that had at least one desirable outcome and no evidence of any undesirable outcomes. These include the following: Who receives care and when ‐ Queuing strategies ‐ Group antenatal care Who provides care – role expansion or task shifting ‐ Lay or community health workers supporting the care of people with hypertension ‐ Community‐based neonatal packages that include additional training of outreach workers ‐ Lay health workers to deliver care for mothers and children or for infectious diseases ‐ Mid‐level, non‐physician providers for abortion care ‐ Health workers providing social support during at‐risk pregnancies ‐ Midwife‐led care for childbearing women and their infants ‐ Non‐specialist health workers or other professionals with health roles to help people with mental, neurological and substance‐abuse disorders ‐ Nurses substituting for physicians in providing care Coordination of care ‐ Structured multidisciplinary care plans (care pathways) used by health care providers in hospitals to detail essential steps in the care of people with a specific clinical problem ‐ Interactive communication between collaborating primary care physicians and specialist physicians in outpatient care ‐ Planning to facilitate patients’ discharge from hospital to home ‐ Adding a new health service to an existing service and integrating services in health care delivery ‐ Integrating vaccination with other healthcare services ‐ Using physicians rather than nurses to lead triage in emergency departments ‐ Groups or teams of midwives providing care for a group of women during pregnancy and childbirth and after childbirth Where care is provided – site of service delivery ‐ Clinics or hospitals that manage a high volume of people living with HIV and AIDS rather than smaller volumes ‐ Intensive home‐based care for people living with HIV and AIDS ‐ Home‐based management of malaria in children ‐ Providing care closer to home for children with long‐term health conditions ‐ Community‐based interventions using lay health workers for childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia ‐ Youth HIV and reproductive health services provided outside of health facilities ‐ Decentralising care for initiation and maintenance of HIV and AIDS medicine treatment to peripheral health centres or lower levels of healthcare Information and communication technology ‐ Mobile phone messaging for people with long‐term illnesses ‐ Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments ‐ Mobile phone messaging to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy ‐ Women carrying their own case notes in pregnancy ‐ Information and communication interventions to improve childhood vaccination coverage Quality and safety systems ‐ Establishing clinical information systems to organize patient data for people living with HIV and AIDS Packages that include multiple interventions ‐ Interventions to improve referral for emergency care during pregnancy and childbirth How up to date is this overview?

Implementing interventions can be challenging, particularly if it entails complex changes in clinical routines; in collaborative patterns among different healthcare providers and disciplines; in the behaviour of providers, patients or other stakeholders; or in the organisation of care. Decision‐makers may use a range of strategies to implement health interventions, and these choices should be based on evidence of the strategies' effectiveness. Objectives To provide an overview of the available evidence from up‐to‐date systematic reviews about the effects of implementation strategies for health systems in low‐income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on alternative implementation strategies and informing refinements of the framework for implementation strategies presented in the overview. Methods We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ‐Evidence up to December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well‐conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of implementation strategies on professional practice and patient outcomes and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the review findings. Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence) and assessments of the relevance of findings to low‐income countries. Main results We identified 7272 systematic reviews and included 39 of them in this overview. An additional four reviews provided supplementary information. Of the 39 reviews, 32 had only minor limitations and 7 had important methodological limitations. Most studies in the reviews were from high‐income countries. There were no studies from low‐income countries in eight reviews. Implementation strategies addressed in the reviews were grouped into four categories – strategies targeting: 1. healthcare organisations (e.g. strategies to change organisational culture; 1 review); 2. healthcare workers by type of intervention (e.g. printed educational materials; 14 reviews); 3. healthcare workers to address a specific problem (e.g. unnecessary antibiotic prescription; 9 reviews); 4. healthcare recipients (e.g. medication adherence; 15 reviews). Overall, we found the following interventions to have desirable effects on at least one outcome with moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of undesirable effects. 1. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers : educational meetings, nutrition training of health workers, educational outreach, practice facilitation, local opinion leaders, audit and feedback, and tailored interventions. 2. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers for specific types of problems : training healthcare workers to be more patient‐centred in clinical consultations, use of birth kits, strategies such as clinician education and patient education to reduce antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory care settings, and in‐service neonatal emergency care training. 3.  Strategies targeted at healthcare recipients : mass media interventions to increase uptake of HIV testing; intensive self‐management and adherence, intensive disease management programmes to improve health literacy; behavioural interventions and mobile phone text messages for adherence to antiretroviral therapy; a one time incentive to start or continue tuberculosis prophylaxis; default reminders for patients being treated for active tuberculosis; use of sectioned polythene bags for adherence to malaria medication; community‐based health education, and reminders and recall strategies to increase vaccination uptake; interventions to increase uptake of cervical screening (invitations, education, counselling, access to health promotion nurse and intensive recruitment); health insurance information and application support. Authors' conclusions Reliable systematic reviews have evaluated a wide range of strategies for implementing evidence‐based interventions in low‐income countries. Most of the available evidence is focused on strategies targeted at healthcare workers and healthcare recipients and relates to process‐based outcomes. Evidence of the effects of strategies targeting healthcare organisations is scarce.

The reviews included a total of 1332 studies. This overview is one of a series of four Cochrane Overviews that evaluate different health system arrangements. What was studied in the overview? A key function of health systems is implementing interventions to improve health. Coverage of essential health interventions remains low in low‐income countries. Decision‐makers may use a range of strategies to implement health interventions, and these choices should be based on evidence of the strategies' effectiveness. What are the main results of the overview? The following implementation strategies had desirable effects on at least one outcome with moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of undesirable effects. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers ‐ Educational meetings. ‐ Nutrition training of health workers. ‐ Educational outreach (vs. no intervention). ‐ Practice facilitation. ‐ Local opinion leaders. ‐ Audit and feedback. ‐ Tailored interventions (vs. no intervention). Strategies targeted at healthcare workers for specific types of problems ‐ Training healthcare workers to be more patient‐centred in clinical consultations. ‐ Use of birth kits. ‐ Clinician education and patient education to reduce antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory care settings. ‐ In‐service neonatal emergency care training. Strategies targeted at healthcare recipients ‐ Mass media interventions to increase immediate uptake of HIV testing (leaflets and gain‐framed videos). ‐ Intensive self‐management and adherence, intensive disease management to improve health literacy. ‐ Behavioural interventions and mobile phone text messages for adherence to antiretroviral therapy. ‐ A one‐time incentive to start or continue tuberculosis prophylaxis. ‐ Default reminders for patients being treated for active tuberculosis. ‐ Use of sectioned polythene bags for adherence to malaria medication. ‐ Community‐based health education, and reminders and recall strategies for vaccination uptake. ‐ Providing free insecticide‐treated bednets. ‐ Interventions to improve uptake of cervical screening (invitations, education, counselling, access to health promotion nurse, and intensive recruitment). ‐ Health insurance information and application support. The following implementation strategies had low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence (or no studies available) for all the outcomes that were considered. Strategies targeted at healthcare organisations ‐ Strategies to improve organisational culture. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers ‐ Printed educational materials. ‐ Internet‐based learning. ‐ Interprofessional education. ‐ Teaching critical appraisal. ‐ Educational outreach (vs. another intervention). ‐ Pharmacist‐provided services. ‐ Safety checklists for use by medical care teams in acute hospital settings. ‐ Tailored interventions (vs. non‐tailored interventions, and interventions targeted at organisational and individual barriers vs. interventions targeted at individual barriers only). ‐ Interventions to encourage the use of systematic reviews in clinical decision‐making. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers for specific types of problems ‐ Interventions to improve handwashing. ‐ Interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean section rates. ‐ Training of traditional birth attendants. ‐ Skilled birth attendance. ‐ Training of traditional healers about STD and HIV medicine. Strategies targeted at healthcare recipients ‐ Providing information/education for promoting HIV testing (multimedia). ‐ Providing written medicine information. ‐ Single interventions to improve health literacy. ‐ Interventions to improve medication adherence. ‐ Adherence – TB (immediate versus deferred incentives; cash vs. non‐cash incentive; different levels of cash incentives; incentives vs. other interventions). ‐ Adherence – malarial medication (blister packed tablets and capsules compared to tablets and capsules in paper envelopes; tablets in sectioned polythene bags compared to bottled syrup). ‐ Training of healthcare workers, home visits, and monetary incentives to improve immunisation coverage. ‐ Risk factor assessment to improve the uptake of cervical cancer screening.

Changes in governance arrangements can affect health and related goals in numerous ways, generally through changes in authority, accountability, openness, participation and coherence. A broad overview of the findings of systematic reviews can help policymakers, their technical support staff and other stakeholders to identify strategies for addressing problems and improving the governance of their health systems. Objectives To provide an overview of the available evidence from up‐to‐date systematic reviews about the effects of governance arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on governance arrangements and informing refinements of the framework for governance arrangements outlined in the overview. Methods We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ Evidence up to 17 December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well‐conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of governance arrangements on patient outcomes (health and health behaviours), the quality or utilisation of healthcare services, resource use (health expenditures, healthcare provider costs, out‐of‐pocket payments, cost‐effectiveness), healthcare provider outcomes (such as sick leave), or social outcomes (such as poverty, employment) and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations that were important enough to compromise the reliability of the findings of the review. Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence) and assessments of the relevance of findings to low‐income countries. Main results We identified 7272 systematic reviews and included 21 of them in this overview (19 primary reviews and 2 supplementary reviews). We focus here on the results of the 19 primary reviews, one of which had important methodological limitations. The other 18 were reliable (with only minor limitations). We grouped the governance arrangements addressed in the reviews into five categories: authority and accountability for health policies (three reviews); authority and accountability for organisations (two reviews); authority and accountability for commercial products (three reviews); authority and accountability for health professionals (seven reviews); and stakeholder involvement (four reviews). Overall, we found desirable effects for the following interventions on at least one outcome, with moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of undesirable effects. Decision‐making about what is covered by health insurance ‐ Placing restrictions on the medicines reimbursed by health insurance systems probably decreases the use of and spending on these medicines (moderate‐certainty evidence). Stakeholder participation in policy and organisational decisions ‐ Participatory learning and action groups for women probably improve newborn survival (moderate‐certainty evidence).  ‐ Consumer involvement in preparing patient information probably improves the quality of the information and patient knowledge (moderate‐certainty evidence). Disclosing performance information to patients and the public ‐ Disclosing performance data on hospital quality to the public probably encourages hospitals to implement quality improvement activities (moderate‐certainty evidence).  ‐ Disclosing performance data on individual healthcare providers to the public probably leads people to select providers that have better quality ratings (moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Investigators have evaluated a wide range of governance arrangements that are relevant for low‐income countries using sound systematic review methods. These strategies have been targeted at different levels in health systems, and studies have assessed a range of outcomes. Moderate‐certainty evidence shows desirable effects (with no undesirable effects) for some interventions. However, there are important gaps in the availability of systematic reviews and primary studies for the all of the main categories of governance arrangements. Plain language summary Effects of governance arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries What is the aim of this overview? The aim of this Cochrane Overview is to provide a broad summary of what is known about the effects of different governance arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries. This overview is based on 19 relevant systematic reviews. These systematic reviews searched for studies that evaluated different types of governance arrangements. The reviews included a total of 172 studies. This overview is one of a series of four Cochrane Overviews that evaluate health system arrangements. Main results What are the effects of different ways of organising authority and accountability for health policies? Three reviews were included and the key findings are that: ‐ collaboration between local health agencies and other local government agencies may lead to little or no difference in physical health or quality of life (low‐certainty evidence); ‐ placing restrictions on the medicines reimbursed by health insurance systems probably decreases the use of and spending on these medicines (moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ it is uncertain if fraud prevention, detection and response interventions reduce healthcare fraud and related spending (very low‐certainty evidence). What are the effects of different ways of organising authority and accountability for organisations? Two reviews were included and the key findings are that: ‐ Contracting non‐state, not‐for‐profit providers to deliver health services may increase access to and use of these services, improve people's health outcomes and reduce household spending on health (low‐certainty evidence). No evidence was available on whether contracting out was more effective than using these funds in the state sector. What are the effects of different ways of organising authority and accountability for commercial products such as medicines and technologies? Three reviews were included and the key findings are that: ‐ systems in which the World Health Organization (WHO) certifies medicine manufacturers (prequalification) and medicines registration (in which medicine regulatory authorities assess medicine manufacturers to ensure they meet international standards) may decrease the proportion of medicines that are substandard or counterfeit (low‐certainty evidence); ‐ establishing a maximum reimbursement for pharmacies dispensing similar medicines covered by insurance may increase the use of generic medicines and may reduce the use of brand‐name medicines (low‐certainty evidence), but it is uncertain whether this approach affects the overall amount spent on medicines (very low‐certainty evidence); ‐ direct‐to‐consumer advertising increases people's requests for medicines and the numbers of prescriptions given (high‐certainty evidence). What are the effects of different ways of organising authority and accountability for healthcare providers? Seven reviews were included and the key findings are that: ‐ training programmes for district health system managers may increase their knowledge of planning processes and their monitoring and evaluation skills (low‐certainty evidence); ‐ reducing immigration restrictions in high‐income countries probably increases the migration of nurses from low‐ and middle‐income to these countries (moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ it is uncertain whether inspection by an external body of healthcare organisation adherence to quality standards improves adherence, quality of care or health‐acquired infection rates in hospitals (very low‐certainty evidence). What are the effects of different ways of organising stakeholder involvement in governing health services? Four reviews were included and the key findings are that: ‐ participatory learning and action groups for women probably improve newborn survival (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may improve maternal survival (low‐certainty evidence); ‐ disclosing performance data on health insurance scheme quality to the public may lead people to select health plans that have better quality ratings or to avoid those with worse ratings and may lead to slight improvements in clinical outcomes for health insurance schemes (low‐certainty evidence); ‐ disclosing performance data on hospital quality to the public may lead to little or no difference in people's selection of hospitals (low‐certainty evidence), probably encourages hospitals to implement quality improvement activities (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may lead to slight improvements in hospital clinical outcomes (low‐certainty evidence); ‐ disclosing performance on individual healthcare providers to the public probably leads people to select providers that have better quality ratings (moderate‐certainty evidence).

Objectives To provide an overview of the evidence from up‐to‐date systematic reviews about the effects of financial arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on financial arrangements, and informing refinements in the framework for financial arrangements presented in the overview.

We did not apply any date, language, or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well‐conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of financial arrangements on patient outcomes (health and health behaviours), the quality or utilisation of healthcare services, resource use, healthcare provider outcomes (such as sick leave), or social outcomes (such as poverty, employment, or financial burden of patients, e.g. out‐of‐pocket payment, catastrophic disease expenditure) and that were published after April 2005.

Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence), and assessments of the relevance of findings to low‐income countries. Main results We identified 7272 reviews and included 15 in this overview, on: collection of funds (2 reviews), insurance schemes (1 review), purchasing of services (1 review), recipient incentives (6 reviews), and provider incentives (5 reviews). The reviews were published between 2008 and 2015; focused on 13 subcategories; and reported results from 276 studies: 115 (42%) randomised trials, 11 (4%) non‐randomised trials, 23 (8%) controlled before‐after studies, 51 (19%) interrupted time series, 9 (3%) repeated measures, and 67 (24%) other non‐randomised studies. Forty‐three per cent (119/276) of the studies included in the reviews took place in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Collection of funds : the effects of changes in user fees on utilisation and equity are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether aid delivered under the Paris Principles (ownership, alignment, harmonisation, managing for results, and mutual accountability) improves health outcomes compared to aid delivered without conforming to those principles (very low‐certainty evidence). Insurance schemes : community‐based health insurance may increase service utilisation (low‐certainty evidence), but the effects on health outcomes are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether social health insurance improves utilisation of health services or health outcomes (very low‐certainty evidence). Purchasing of services : it is uncertain whether increasing salaries of public sector healthcare workers improves the quantity or quality of their work (very low‐certainty evidence). Recipient incentives : recipient incentives may improve adherence to long‐term treatments (low‐certainty evidence), but it is uncertain whether they improve patient outcomes. One‐time recipient incentives probably improve patient return for start or continuation of treatment (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may improve return for tuberculosis test readings (low‐certainty evidence). However, incentives may not improve completion of tuberculosis prophylaxis, and it is uncertain whether they improve completion of treatment for active tuberculosis. Conditional cash transfer programmes probably lead to an increase in service utilisation (moderate‐certainty evidence), but their effects on health outcomes are uncertain. Vouchers may improve health service utilisation (low‐certainty evidence), but the effects on health outcomes are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). Introducing a restrictive cap may decrease use of medicines for symptomatic conditions and overall use of medicines, may decrease insurers' expenditures on medicines (low‐certainty evidence), and has uncertain effects on emergency department use, hospitalisations, and use of outpatient care (very low‐certainty evidence). Reference pricing, maximum pricing, and index pricing for drugs have mixed effects on drug expenditures by patients and insurers as well as the use of brand and generic drugs. Provider incentives : the effects of provider incentives are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence), including: the effects of provider incentives on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians or outpatient referrals from primary to secondary care, incentives for recruiting and retaining health professionals to serve in remote areas, and the effects of pay‐for‐performance on provider performance, the utilisation of services, patient outcomes, or resource use in low‐income countries. Authors' conclusions Research based on sound systematic review methods has evaluated numerous financial arrangements relevant to low‐income countries, targeting different levels of the health systems and assessing diverse outcomes. However, included reviews rarely reported social outcomes, resource use, equity impacts, or undesirable effects. We also identified gaps in primary research because of uncertainty about applicability of the evidence to low‐income countries. Financial arrangements for which the effects are uncertain include external funding (aid), caps and co‐payments, pay‐for‐performance, and provider incentives. Further studies evaluating the effects of these arrangements are needed in low‐income countries. Systematic reviews should include all outcomes that are relevant to decision‐makers and to people affected by changes in financial arrangements. Plain language summary Financial arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries What is the aim of this overview? The aim of this Cochrane Overview is to provide a broad summary of what is known about the effects of financial arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries. This overview is based on 15 systematic reviews. Each of these systematic reviews searched for studies that evaluated different types of financial arrangements within the scope of the review question. The reviews included a total of 276 studies. This overview is one of a series of four Cochrane Overviews that evaluate different health system arrangements. Main results What are the effects of different ways of collecting funds to pay for health services?   Two reviews looked for studies that addressed this question and found the following. ‐ The effects of changes in user fees on utilisation and equity are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ It is uncertain whether aid delivered under Paris Principles (ownership, alignment, harmonisation, managing for results, and mutual accountability) improves health compared to aid delivered without conforming to those principles (very low‐certainty evidence). What are the effects of different types of insurance schemes?   One systematic review looked for studies that addressed this question and found the following. ‐ Community‐based health insurance may increase people's use of services (low‐certainty evidence), but the effects on people's health are uncertain. It is uncertain whether social health insurance increases people's use of services (very low‐certainty evidence). What are the effects of different ways of paying for health services?   One systematic review looked for studies that addressed this question and found the following. ‐ It is uncertain whether increasing salaries of public sector healthcare workers improves the quantity or quality of their work. What are the effects of different types of financial incentives for recipients of care?   Six systematic reviews looked for studies that addressed this question and found the following. ‐ Giving healthcare recipients incentives may improve their adherence to long‐term treatments (low‐certainty evidence), but it is uncertain whether they improve people's health. ‐ Giving healthcare recipients one‐time incentives probably leads more people to return to start or continue treatment for tuberculosis (moderate‐certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence for other types of recipient incentives for tuberculosis is low or very low. ‐ Conditional cash transfer programmes (giving money to recipients of care on the condition that they take a specified action to improve their health) probably increase people's use of services (moderate‐certainty evidence), but have mixed effect on people's health. ‐ Vouchers may improve people's use of health services (low‐certainty evidence) but have mixed effects on people's health (low‐certainty evidence). ‐ A combination of a ceiling and co‐insurance probably slightly decreases the overall use of medicines (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may increase health service utilisation (low‐certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence for the effects of other combinations of caps, co‐insurance, co‐payments, and ceilings is low or very low. ‐ Limits on how much insurers pay for different groups of drugs (reference pricing, maximum pricing, and index pricing) have mixed effects on drug expenditures by patients and insurers as well as the use of brand and generic drugs. What are the effects of different types of financial incentives for health workers?   Five systematic reviews looked for studies that addressed this question and found the following. ‐ We are uncertain whether pay‐for‐performance improves health worker performance, people's use of services, people's health, or resource use in low‐income countries (very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ We are uncertain whether financial incentives for health workers improve the quality of care provided by primary care physicians or outpatient referrals from primary to secondary care (very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ There is no rigorous research evaluating incentives (e.g. bursaries or scholarships linked to future practice location, rural allowances) for recruiting health workers to serve in remote areas. It is uncertain whether giving health workers incentives lead more of them to stay in underserved areas (very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ No studies assessed the effects of financial interventions on the movement of health workers between public and private organisations in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

Interventions that reduce antibiotic prescribing by clinicians are expected to reduce antibiotic resistance. Disparate interventions to change antibiotic prescribing behaviour for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) have been trialled and meta‐analysed, but not yet synthesised in an overview. This overview synthesises evidence from systematic reviews, rather than individual trials. Objectives To systematically review the existing evidence from systematic reviews on the effects of interventions aimed at influencing clinician antibiotic prescribing behaviour for ARIs in primary care. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Science Citation Index to June 2016. We also searched the reference lists of all included reviews. We ran a pre‐publication search in May 2017 and placed additional studies in 'awaiting classification'. We included both Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of any clinician‐focussed intervention on antibiotic prescribing behaviour in primary care. Two overview authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of included reviews using the ROBIS tool, with disagreements reached by consensus or by discussion with a third overview author. We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of evidence in included reviews. The results are presented as a narrative overview. Main results We included eight reviews in this overview: five Cochrane Reviews (33 included trials) and three non‐Cochrane reviews (11 included trials). Three reviews (all Cochrane Reviews) scored low risk across all the ROBIS domains in Phase 2 and low risk of bias overall. The remaining five reviews scored high risk on Domain 4 of Phase 2 because the 'Risk of bias' assessment had not been specifically considered and discussed in the review Results and Conclusions. The trials included in the reviews varied in both size and risk of bias. Interventions were compared to usual care. Moderate‐quality evidence indicated that C‐reactive protein (CRP) point‐of‐care testing (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.92, 3284 participants, 6 trials), shared decision making (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75, 3274 participants, 3 trials; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84, 4623 participants, 2 trials; risk difference ‐18.44, 95% CI ‐27.24 to ‐9.65, 481,807 participants, 4 trials), and procalcitonin‐guided management (adjusted OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.14, 1008 participants, 2 trials) probably reduce antibiotic prescribing in general practice. We found moderate‐quality evidence that procalcitonin‐guided management probably reduces antibiotic prescribing in emergency departments (adjusted OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.43, 2605 participants, 7 trials). The overall effect of these interventions was small (few achieving greater than 50% reduction in antibiotic prescribing, most about a quarter or less), but likely to be clinically important. Compared to usual care, shared decision making probably makes little or no difference to reconsultation for the same illness (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03, 1860 participants, 4 trials, moderate‐quality evidence), and may make little or no difference to patient satisfaction (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.30, 1110 participants, 2 trials, low‐quality evidence). Similarly, CRP testing probably has little or no effect on patient satisfaction (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.08, 689 participants, 2 trials, moderate‐quality evidence) or reconsultation (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27, 5132 participants, 4 trials, moderate‐quality evidence). Procalcitonin‐guided management probably results in little or no difference in treatment failure in general practice compared to normal care (adjusted OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24, 1008 participants, 2 trials, moderate‐quality evidence), however it probably reduces treatment failure in the emergency department compared to usual care (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95, 2605 participants, 7 trials, moderate‐quality evidence). The quality of evidence for interventions focused on clinician educational materials and decision support in reducing antibiotic prescribing in general practice was either low or very low (no pooled result reported) and trial results were highly heterogeneous, therefore we were unable draw conclusions about the effects of these interventions. The use of rapid viral diagnostics in emergency departments may have little or no effect on antibiotic prescribing (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.22, 891 participants, 3 trials, low‐quality evidence) and may result in little to no difference in reconsultation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.25, 200 participants, 1 trial, low‐quality evidence). None of the trials in the included reviews reported on management costs for the treatment of an ARI or any associated complications. Authors' conclusions We found evidence that CRP testing, shared decision making, and procalcitonin‐guided management reduce antibiotic prescribing for patients with ARIs in primary care. These interventions may therefore reduce overall antibiotic consumption and consequently antibiotic resistance. There do not appear to be negative effects of these interventions on the outcomes of patient satisfaction and reconsultation, although there was limited measurement of these outcomes in the trials. This should be rectified in future trials. We could gather no information about the costs of management, and this along with the paucity of measurements meant that it was difficult to weigh the benefits and costs of implementing these interventions in practice. Most of this research was undertaken in high‐income countries, and it may not generalise to other settings. The quality of evidence for the interventions of educational materials and tools for patients and clinicians was either low or very low, which prevented us from drawing any conclusions. High‐quality trials are needed to further investigate these interventions. Plain language summary Strategies to help doctors change the way they prescribe antibiotics for patients with acute respiratory infections Overview question This overview aimed to summarise all evidence from systematic reviews on strategies directed at doctors to reduce the antibiotic prescriptions they give to patients with acute respiratory infections (ear, nose, throat or chest infections). Background It is important that antibiotics are used for illnesses where they can make a difference to patients’ symptoms and recovery and that they are available for those infections that are serious and can lead to disability or death. Antibiotics may make very little or no difference for patients who have ear, nose, throat, or chest infections that are caused by a virus (e.g. a cold, flu, or sore throat). Doctors can prescribe antibiotics too readily for patients with these symptoms. Strategies to change doctors’ antibiotic prescribing habits have been developed to reduce the number of antibiotics given to patients with these symptoms. Several types of strategies exist, and it is important to bring together all the information on how these work. Study characteristics We identified five Cochrane Reviews and three non‐Cochrane reviews. The reviews varied in how many trials they included and the number of participants within trials. The quality of both the reviews and trials varied. Key results We found moderate‐quality evidence that three types of strategies probably help to reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Strategies that encourage the use of shared decision making between doctors and their patients, C‐reactive protein tests, and procalcitonin‐guided management (both tests that measure the amount of proteins in the blood, which may be raised in the case of infection) all probably reduce antibiotic prescribing in general practice. Procalcitonin‐guided management also probably reduces antibiotic prescribing in emergency departments. These strategies seem to change antibiotic prescribing whilst keeping patients happy with their consultation and ensuring that they did not need to return to their doctor for the same illness. There was no information about the cost of these strategies, so it was difficult to weigh up the benefits and costs. The quality of the evidence for strategies that aim to educate doctors about antibiotic prescribing, that provide decision aids for doctors to help them change their prescribing, and for the use of rapid viral diagnostics in emergency departments was either low or very low, meaning that we were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effects of these strategies. In conclusion, we determined that some strategies aimed at doctors can probably help to reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Further studies are needed for other types of strategies where there is less information about whether they can change prescribing.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Primary Health Care; *Review Literature as Topic; Acute Disease; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; C-Reactive Protein [analysis]; Calcitonin [blood]; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Inappropriate Prescribing [*prevention & control]; Publication Bias; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [blood, *drug therapy, virology]; Virus Diseases [diagnosis]","10.1002/14651858.CD012252.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012252.pub2","Acute Respiratory Infections"

As there are diverse risk factors and causes, no one strategy will prevent all cerebral palsy. Therefore, there is a need to systematically consider all potentially relevant interventions for their contribution to prevention. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane reviews regarding the effects of antenatal and intrapartum interventions for preventing cerebral palsy. Methods We searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  on 7 August 2016, for reviews of antenatal or intrapartum interventions reporting on cerebral palsy. Two authors assessed reviews for inclusion, extracted data, assessed review quality, using AMSTAR and ROBIS, and quality of the evidence, using the GRADE approach. We organised reviews by topic, and summarised findings in text and tables. We categorised interventions as effective (high‐quality evidence of effectiveness); possibly effective (moderate‐quality evidence of effectiveness); ineffective (high‐quality evidence of harm or of lack of effectiveness); probably ineffective (moderate‐quality evidence of harm or of lack of effectiveness); and no conclusions possible (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). Main results We included 15 Cochrane reviews. A further 62 reviews pre‐specified the outcome cerebral palsy in their methods, but none of the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported this outcome. The included reviews were high quality and at low risk of bias. They included 279 RCTs; data for cerebral palsy were available from 27 (10%) RCTs, involving 32,490 children. They considered interventions for: treating mild to moderate hypertension (two) and pre‐eclampsia (two); diagnosing and preventing fetal compromise in labour (one); preventing preterm birth (four); preterm fetal maturation or neuroprotection (five); and managing preterm fetal compromise (one). Quality of evidence ranged from very low to high. Effective interventions: high‐quality evidence of effectiveness There was a reduction in cerebral palsy in children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.87; five RCTs; 6145 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate‐quality evidence of harm There was an increase in cerebral palsy in children born to mothers in preterm labour with intact membranes who received any prophylactic antibiotics versus no antibiotics (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.34; one RCT; 3173 children). There was an increase in cerebral palsy in children, who as preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise, were born immediately compared with those for whom birth was deferred (RR 5.88, 95% CI 1.33 to 26.02; one RCT; 507 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate‐quality evidence of lack of effectiveness There was no clear difference in the presence of cerebral palsy in children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received repeat doses of corticosteroids compared with a single course (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50; four RCTs; 3800 children). No conclusions possible: low‐ to very low‐quality evidence Low‐quality evidence found there was a possible reduction in cerebral palsy for children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation compared with placebo (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03; five RCTs; 904 children). There was no clear difference in the presence of cerebral palsy with interventionist care for severe pre‐eclampsia versus expectant care (RR 6.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 48.14; one RCT; 262 children); magnesium sulphate for pre‐eclampsia versus placebo (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.26; one RCT; 2895 children); continuous cardiotocography for fetal assessment during labour versus intermittent auscultation (average RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.63; two RCTs; 13,252 children); prenatal progesterone for prevention of preterm birth versus placebo (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.48; one RCT; 274 children); and betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour versus placebo (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.63; one RCT; 246 children). Very low‐quality found no clear difference for the presence of cerebral palsy with any antihypertensive drug (oral beta‐blockers) for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension versus placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.01; one RCT; 110 children); magnesium sulphate for prevention of preterm birth versus other tocolytic agents (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.51; one RCT; 106 children); and vitamin K and phenobarbital prior to preterm birth for prevention of neonatal periventricular haemorrhage versus placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.76; one RCT; 299 children). Authors' conclusions This overview summarises evidence from Cochrane reviews on the effects of antenatal and intrapartum interventions on cerebral palsy, and can be used by researchers, funding bodies, policy makers, clinicians and consumers to aid decision‐making and evidence translation. We recommend that readers consult the included Cochrane reviews to formally assess other benefits or harms of included interventions, including impacts on risk factors for cerebral palsy (such as the reduction in intraventricular haemorrhage for preterm babies following exposure to antenatal corticosteroids). Magnesium sulphate for women at risk of preterm birth for fetal neuroprotection can prevent cerebral palsy. Prophylactic antibiotics for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, and immediate rather than deferred birth of preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise, may increase the risk of cerebral palsy. Repeat doses compared with a single course of antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth do not clearly impact the risk of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is rarely diagnosed at birth, has diverse risk factors and causes, and is diagnosed in approximately one in 500 children. To date, only a small proportion of Cochrane reviews assessing antenatal and intrapartum interventions have been able to report on this outcome. There is an urgent need for long‐term follow‐up of RCTs of interventions addressing risk factors for cerebral palsy, and consideration of the use of relatively new interim assessments (including the General Movements Assessment). Such RCTs must be rigorous in their design, and aim for consistency in cerebral palsy outcome measurement and reporting to facilitate pooling of data, to focus research efforts on prevention. Plain language summary Interventions during pregnancy and childbirth for preventing cerebral palsy: an overview of Cochrane reviews What is the issue? Cerebral palsy is a term that includes a group of conditions affecting people's ability to move, and is the most common physical disability in childhood. Cerebral palsy is usually due to events before, during, or after childbirth that lead to injury in babies' developing brains. There is no single cause of cerebral palsy. For many children, the cause of cerebral palsy is unclear, however, there are many known risk factors. The biggest risk factor is birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm birth). Other risk factors for mothers include some medical conditions (including thyroid problems), abnormalities of the placenta, pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine), and some bacterial and viral infections. For babies, risk factors include congenital and genetic abnormalities, having a low birthweight or growth restricted as a fetus, being a twin or triplet, some infections, and prolonged loss of oxygen during birth. Why is this important? As there are different risk factors and causes for cerebral palsy, it is likely that various different interventions (treatments) may be needed to prevent cerebral palsy by reducing risk factors. This overview summarises the evidence about preventing cerebral palsy from Cochrane reviews of interventions during pregnancy and childbirth. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence on 7 August 2016. We identified 15 Cochrane reviews that assessed interventions during pregnancy or childbirth that reported on cerebral palsy, with information from 27 randomised controlled trials involving 32,490 children. The reviews were all high quality, but the quality of the evidence about cerebral palsy ranged from very low to high. The interventions assessed were for treating mild to moderate hypertension (two reviews), treating pre‐eclampsia (two reviews), diagnosing or preventing fetal compromise (when the unborn baby may not be well) during labour (one review), preventing preterm birth (four reviews), maturing or protecting babies' lungs or brains before preterm birth (five reviews), and managing fetal compromise of preterm babies (one review). We found high‐quality evidence that one intervention was effective for cerebral palsy prevention: preterm children born to mothers who received magnesium sulphate before birth were less likely to develop cerebral palsy than children whose mothers received a placebo (five trials, 6145 children). We found moderate‐quality evidence that two interventions were probably ineffective, and could cause harm: (i) children born to mothers who had received antibiotics for preterm labour when their waters had not broken were more likely to develop cerebral palsy than children whose mothers did not receive antibiotics (one trial, 3173 children); and (ii) preterm children who were born immediately when there was suspected fetal compromise were more likely to develop cerebral palsy than those for whom birth was postponed (one trial, 507 children). We found moderate‐quality evidence that there was no clear difference in the chance of children to develop cerebral palsy whether their mothers received one or more courses of corticosteroids before preterm birth (four trials, 3800 children). There was low‐quality evidence as to whether the other interventions prevented, increased, or had no impact on cerebral palsy, although we did find that children born to mothers who received corticosteroids to help mature their lungs before preterm birth were potentially less likely to develop cerebral palsy than those born to mothers who received a placebo (five trials, 904 children). What does this mean? We identified one intervention that was effective in preventing cerebral palsy (magnesium sulphate before preterm birth), two that appeared to cause harm (preventive antibiotics for women in preterm labour when their waters have not broken, and immediate birth for preterm babies with suspected compromise), and one that did not appear to make a clear difference (more than one course of corticosteroids before preterm birth). For the other interventions assessed, there was not enough evidence to reach any conclusions. Further good quality randomised controlled trials, assessing interventions that might impact cerebral palsy risk factors, with long‐term follow‐up to measure cerebral palsy, are needed. We identified over 60 other Cochrane reviews that may provide more information in the future.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Parturition; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Cerebral Palsy [epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Female; Fetal Distress [therapy]; Humans; Hypertension [therapy]; Infant, Premature; Magnesium Sulfate [therapeutic use]; Neuroprotective Agents [therapeutic use]; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular [therapy]; Premature Birth [prevention & control]; Prenatal Care [*methods]; Pre‐Eclampsia [therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012077.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012077.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"
"CD012592.PUB2","Wiffen, PJ; Wee, B; Derry, S; Bell, RF; Moore, RA","Opioids for cancer pain ‐ an overview of Cochrane reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Pain is a common symptom with cancer, and 30% to 50% of all people with cancer will experience moderate to severe pain that can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine‐like) drugs are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. The most commonly‐used opioid drugs are buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, tramadol, and tapentadol. Objectives To provide an overview of the analgesic efficacy of opioids in cancer pain, and to report on adverse events associated with their use. Methods We identified systematic reviews examining any opioid for cancer pain published to 4 May 2017 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes were no or mild pain within 14 days of starting treatment, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. Main results We included nine reviews with 152 included studies and 13,524 participants, but because some studies appeared in more than one review the number of unique studies and participants was smaller than this. Most participants had moderate or severe pain associated with a range of different types of cancer. Studies in the reviews typically compared one type of opioid or formulation with either a different formulation of the same opioid, or a different opioid; few included a placebo control. Typically the reviews titrated dose to effect, a balance between pain relief and adverse events. Various routes of administration of opioids were considered in the reviews; oral with most opioids, but transdermal administration with fentanyl, and buprenorphine. No review included studies of subcutaneous opioid administration. Pain outcomes reported were varied and inconsistent. The average size of included studies varied considerably between reviews: studies of older opioids, such as codeine, morphine, and methadone, had low average study sizes while those involving newer drugs tended to have larger study sizes. Six reviews reported a GRADE assessment (buprenorphine, codeine, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, and tramadol), but not necessarily for all comparisons or outcomes. No comparative analyses were possible because there was no consistent placebo or active control. Cohort outcomes for opioids are therefore reported, as absolute numbers or percentages, or both. Reviews on buprenorphine, codeine with or without paracetamol, hydromorphone, methadone, tramadol with or without paracetamol, tapentadol, and oxycodone did not have information about the primary outcome of mild or no pain at 14 days, although that on oxycodone indicated that average pain scores were within that range. Two reviews, on oral morphine and transdermal fentanyl, reported that 96% of 850 participants achieved that goal. Adverse event withdrawal was reported by five reviews, at rates of between 6% and 19%. Participants with at least one adverse event were reported by three reviews, at rates of between 11% and 77%. Our GRADE assessment of evidence quality was very low for all outcomes, because many studies in the reviews were at high risk of bias from several sources, including small study size. Authors' conclusions The amount and quality of evidence around the use of opioids for treating cancer pain is disappointingly low, although the evidence we have indicates that around 19 out of 20 people with moderate or severe pain who are given opioids and can tolerate them should have that pain reduced to mild or no pain within 14 days. This accords with the clinical experience in treating many people with cancer pain, but overstates to some extent the effectiveness found for the WHO pain ladder. Most people will experience adverse events, and help may be needed to manage the more common undesirable adverse effects such as constipation and nausea. Perhaps between 1 in 10 and 2 in 10 people treated with opioids will find these adverse events intolerable, leading to a change in treatment. Plain language summary Morphine‐like drugs for cancer pain Bottom line In about 19 of 20 people with moderate to severe pain from cancer, morphine‐like drugs (opioids) can probably reduce pain to mild or no pain within 14 days if they can tolerate the side effects. Most people will have side effects, and about 1 in 10 to 2 in 10 will need to change their treatment because of side effects. Background One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. Morphine taken by mouth has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain. In 1986 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended taking morphine‐like drugs for moderate to severe pain from cancer. A number of different drugs are available, some taken by mouth, but others applied in stick‐on patches. Study characteristics In this overview of Cochrane Reviews we examined all the evidence on how well morphine‐like drugs worked, mostly when taken by mouth or through a skin patch, how many people had side effects, and how severe or troublesome those side effects were — for example, whether they caused participants to stop taking their medicines. In May 2017, we found nine reviews with 152 included studies and 13,524 participants. The studies were often small, and compared many different preparations. They used different study designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes of importance to people with cancer pain were often not reported. Key findings For two drugs (morphine by mouth and fentanyl patches) more than 19 in 20 people had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine‐like drugs, to pain that was no worse than mild within 14 days if they can tolerate the side effects. Most people taking a morphine‐like drug had at least one side effect. Only about 1 person in 10 to 2 people in 10 stopped taking it because of side effects. The most common side effects were constipation, and nausea and vomiting. Quality of the evidence At one level these are encouraging results, and generally agree with surveys of how well the WHO advice works in cancer pain. On another level, the quality of studies in the reviews was generally poor. We would like better study design, and especially better study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to a level where people with cancer can cope with it (no pain or mild pain). We found that the Cochrane Reviews were of high quality. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We rated the evidence in the reviews as very low quality.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Review Literature as Topic; Acetaminophen [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Administration, Cutaneous; Administration, Oral; Analgesics, Opioid [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Buprenorphine [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Cancer Pain [*drug therapy]; Codeine [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Fentanyl [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Humans; Hydromorphone [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Methadone [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Oxycodone [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Phenols [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Tapentadol; Tramadol [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD012592.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012592.pub2","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

Some are acute, typically strains or sprains, tendinopathy, or muscle aches. Others are chronic, typically osteoarthritis of hand or knee, or neuropathic pain. Objectives To provide an overview of the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of topical analgesics (primarily nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylate rubefacients, capsaicin, and lidocaine) applied to intact skin for the treatment of acute and chronic pain in adults. Methods We identified systematic reviews in acute and chronic pain published to February 2017 in the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (the Cochrane Library). The primary outcome was at least 50% pain relief (participant‐reported) at an appropriate duration. We extracted the number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for efficacy outcomes for each topical analgesic or formulation, and the number needed to treat for one additional harmful outcome (NNH) for adverse events. We also extracted information on withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, systemic and local adverse events, and serious adverse events. We required information from at least 200 participants, in at least two studies. We judged that there was potential for publication bias if the addition of four studies of typical size (400 participants) with zero effect increased NNT compared with placebo to 10 (minimal clinical utility). We extracted GRADE assessment in the original papers, and made our own GRADE assessment. Main results Thirteen Cochrane Reviews (206 studies with around 30,700 participants) assessed the efficacy and harms from a range of topical analgesics applied to intact skin in a number of acute and chronic painful conditions. Reviews were overseen by several Review Groups, and concentrated on evidence comparing topical analgesic with topical placebo; comparisons of topical and oral analgesics were rare. For at least 50% pain relief, we considered evidence was moderate or high quality for several therapies, based on the underlying quality of studies and susceptibility to publication bias. In acute musculoskeletal pain (strains and sprains) with assessment at about seven days, therapies were diclofenac Emulgel (78% Emulgel, 20% placebo; 2 studies, 314 participants, NNT 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.1)), ketoprofen gel (72% ketoprofen, 33% placebo, 5 studies, 348 participants, NNT 2.5 (2.0 to 3.4)), piroxicam gel (70% piroxicam, 47% placebo, 3 studies, 522 participants, NNT 4.4 (3.2 to 6.9)), diclofenac Flector plaster (63% Flector, 41% placebo, 4 studies, 1030 participants, NNT 4.7 (3.7 to 6.5)), and diclofenac other plaster (88% diclofenac plaster, 57% placebo, 3 studies, 474 participants, NNT 3.2 (2.6 to 4.2)). In chronic musculoskeletal pain (mainly hand and knee osteoarthritis) therapies were topical diclofenac preparations for less than six weeks (43% diclofenac, 23% placebo, 5 studies, 732 participants, NNT 5.0 (3.7 to 7.4)), ketoprofen over 6 to 12 weeks (63% ketoprofen, 48% placebo, 4 studies, 2573 participants, NNT 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3)), and topical diclofenac preparations over 6 to 12 weeks (60% diclofenac, 50% placebo, 4 studies, 2343 participants, NNT 9.8 (7.1 to 16)). In postherpetic neuralgia, topical high‐concentration capsaicin had moderate‐quality evidence of limited efficacy (33% capsaicin, 24% placebo, 2 studies, 571 participants, NNT 11 (6.1 to 62)). We judged evidence of efficacy for other therapies as low or very low quality. Limited evidence of efficacy, potentially subject to publication bias, existed for topical preparations of ibuprofen gels and creams, unspecified diclofenac formulations and diclofenac gel other than Emulgel, indomethacin, and ketoprofen plaster in acute pain conditions, and for salicylate rubefacients for chronic pain conditions. Evidence for other interventions (other topical NSAIDs, topical salicylate in acute pain conditions, low concentration capsaicin, lidocaine, clonidine for neuropathic pain, and herbal remedies for any condition) was very low quality and typically limited to single studies or comparisons with sparse data. We assessed the evidence on withdrawals as moderate or very low quality, because of small numbers of events. In chronic pain conditions lack of efficacy withdrawals were lower with topical diclofenac (6%) than placebo (9%) (11 studies, 3455 participants, number needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) 26, moderate‐quality evidence), and topical salicylate (2% vs 7% for placebo) (5 studies, 501 participants, NNTp 21, very low‐quality evidence). Adverse event withdrawals were higher with topical capsaicin low‐concentration (15%) than placebo (3%) (4 studies, 477 participants, NNH 8, very low‐quality evidence), topical salicylate (5% vs 1% for placebo) (7 studies, 735 participants, NNH 26, very low‐quality evidence), and topical diclofenac (5% vs 4% for placebo) (12 studies, 3552 participants, NNH 51, very low‐quality evidence). In acute pain, systemic or local adverse event rates with topical NSAIDs (4.3%) were no greater than with topical placebo (4.6%) (42 studies, 6740 participants, high quality evidence). In chronic pain local adverse events with topical capsaicin low concentration (63%) were higher than topical placebo (5 studies, 557 participants, number needed to treat for harm (NNH) 2.6), high quality evidence. Moderate‐quality evidence indicated more local adverse events than placebo in chronic pain conditions with topical diclofenac (NNH 16) and local pain with topical capsaicin high‐concentration (NNH 16). There was moderate‐quality evidence of no additional local adverse events with topical ketoprofen over topical placebo in chronic pain. Serious adverse events were rare (very low‐quality evidence). GRADE assessments of moderate or low quality in some of the reviews were considered by us to be very low because of small numbers of participants and events. Authors' conclusions There is good evidence that some formulations of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen are useful in acute pain conditions such as sprains or strains, with low (good) NNT values. There is a strong message that the exact formulation used is critically important in acute conditions, and that might also apply to other pain conditions. In chronic musculoskeletal conditions with assessments over 6 to 12 weeks, topical diclofenac and ketoprofen had limited efficacy in hand and knee osteoarthritis, as did topical high‐concentration capsaicin in postherpetic neuralgia. Though NNTs were higher, this still indicates that a small proportion of people had good pain relief. Use of GRADE in Cochrane Reviews with small numbers of participants and events requires attention. Plain language summary Do painkillers rubbed on the skin really work? Bottom line Diclofenac Emulgel, ketoprofen gel, piroxicam gel, and diclofenac plaster work reasonably well for strains and sprains. For hand and knee osteoarthritis, the nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen rubbed on the skin for at least 6 to 12 weeks help reduce pain by at least half in a modest number of people. For postherpetic neuralgia (pain following shingles), topical high‐concentration capsaicin (derived from chili peppers) can reduce pain by at least half in a small number of people. Background Painkillers rubbed onto the skin are called topical (local) painkillers (analgesics). There has been considerable debate over whether, how, and in what painful condition, they work. Study characteristics We looked for systematic reviews examining topical painkillers in the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (the Cochrane Library) published up to February 2017. Reviews assessed treatment of short‐term (acute, less than three months) or long‐term (chronic, more than three months) pain conditions. We examined how well the topical painkillers worked, any harm they caused, and whether people dropped out of the studies. We also looked at the quality of the evidence. Key results Most reviews assessed the effects of a topical painkiller with a topical placebo. A topical placebo is the same as the active material, except that it has no painkiller in it. Using a placebo cancels out the effects that rubbing might have for some of these topical analgesics. For strains and sprains, several topical NSAID painkillers rubbed on the skin help reduce pain by at least half over about a week in around 1 in 2 to 1 in 5 people. These are diclofenac Emulgel, ketoprofen gel, piroxicam gel, diclofenac Flector plaster, and diclofenac other plaster. How the drugs are made up is important in determining how well they work. For hand and knee osteoarthritis the NSAID painkillers topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen rubbed on the skin help reduce pain by at least half over at least 6 to 12 weeks in around 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 people. For postherpetic neuralgia, a single application of topical high‐concentration capsaicin can reduce pain by at least half in around 1 in 12 people for 8 to 12 weeks. There is no good evidence to support any other topical painkiller in any other painful condition. Topical low‐concentration capsaicin caused local side events (such as itching or rash) in 4 in 10 people, and side effects caused withdrawal in 1 in 12 people. Side effects and withdrawal because of side effects were otherwise uncommon or not different from those with a topical placebo. Serious side effects were uncommon. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low. The main reason for evidence being very low quality was the small number of participants in some studies, which make it impossible (or unsafe) to estimate benefit or harm.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acute Pain [*drug therapy]; Adult; Analgesics [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis, Rheumatoid [drug therapy]; Capsaicin [therapeutic use]; Chronic Pain [*drug therapy]; Diclofenac [therapeutic use]; Humans; Ketoprofen; Musculoskeletal Pain [drug therapy]; Neuralgia [drug therapy]; Numbers Needed To Treat; Osteoarthritis [drug therapy]; Piroxicam [therapeutic use]; Publication Bias; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008609.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008609.pub2","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

We performed a systematic review, a standard meta‐analysis and a network meta‐analysis (NMA) to update the 2009 Cochrane Overview. This review is focused on the adults with RA who are naive to methotrexate (MTX) that is, receiving their first disease‐modifying agent. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) and small molecule tofacitinib versus comparator (methotrexate (MTX)/other DMARDs) in people with RA who are naive to methotrexate. Methods In June 2015 we searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase; and trials registers. We used standard Cochrane methods. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for traditional meta‐analyses and 95% credible intervals (CrI) using a Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons approach for network meta‐analysis (NMA). We converted OR to risk ratios (RR) for ease of interpretation. We also present results in absolute measures as risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial or harmful outcome (NNTB/H). Main results Nineteen RCTs with 6485 participants met inclusion criteria (including five studies from the original 2009 review), and data were available for four TNF biologics (adalimumab (six studies; 1851 participants), etanercept (three studies; 678 participants), golimumab (one study; 637 participants) and infliximab (seven studies; 1363 participants)) and two non‐TNF biologics (abatacept (one study; 509 participants) and rituximab (one study; 748 participants)). Less than 50% of the studies were judged to be at low risk of bias for allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, 21% were at low risk for selective reporting, 53% had low risk of bias for attrition and 89% had low risk of bias for major baseline imbalance. Three trials used biologic monotherapy, that is, without MTX. There were no trials with placebo‐only comparators and no trials of tofacitinib. Trial duration ranged from 6 to 24 months. Half of the trials contained participants with early RA (less than two years' duration) and the other half included participants with established RA (2 to 10 years). Biologic + MTX versus active comparator (MTX ( 17 trials (6344 participants) /MTX + methylprednisolone  2 trials (141 participants) ) In traditional meta‐analyses, there was moderate‐quality evidence downgraded for inconsistency that biologics with MTX were associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit versus comparator as demonstrated by ACR50 (American College of Rheumatology scale) and RA remission rates. For ACR50, biologics with MTX showed a risk ratio (RR) of 1.40 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.49), absolute difference of 16% (95% CI 13% to 20%) and NNTB = 7 (95% CI 6 to 8). For RA remission rates, biologics with MTX showed a RR of 1.62 (95% CI 1.33 to 1.98), absolute difference of 15% (95% CI 11% to 19%) and NNTB = 5 (95% CI 6 to 7). Biologics with MTX were also associated with a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, benefit in physical function (moderate‐quality evidence downgraded for inconsistency), with an improvement of HAQ scores of ‐0.10 (95% CI ‐0.16 to ‐0.04 on a 0 to 3 scale), absolute difference ‐3.3% (95% CI ‐5.3% to ‐1.3%) and NNTB = 4 (95% CI 2 to 15). We did not observe evidence of differences between biologics with MTX compared to MTX for radiographic progression (low‐quality evidence, downgraded for imprecision and inconsistency) or serious adverse events (moderate‐quality evidence, downgraded for imprecision). Based on low‐quality evidence, results were inconclusive for withdrawals due to adverse events (RR of 1.32, but 95% confidence interval included possibility of important harm, 0.89 to 1.97). Results for cancer were also inconclusive (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.33) and downgraded to low‐quality evidence for serious imprecision. Biologic without MTX versus active comparator (MTX  3 trials (866 participants) There was no evidence of statistically significant or clinically important differences for ACR50, HAQ, remission, (moderate‐quality evidence for these benefits, downgraded for imprecision), withdrawals due to adverse events,and serious adverse events (low‐quality evidence for these harms, downgraded for serious imprecision). All studies were for TNF biologic monotherapy and none for non‐TNF biologic monotherapy. Radiographic progression was not measured. Authors' conclusions In MTX‐naive RA participants, there was moderate‐quality evidence that, compared with MTX alone, biologics with MTX was associated with absolute and relative clinically meaningful benefits in three of the efficacy outcomes (ACR50, HAQ scores, and RA remission rates). A benefit regarding less radiographic progression with biologics with MTX was not evident (low‐quality evidence). We found moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence that biologic therapy with MTX was not associated with any higher risk of serious adverse events compared with MTX, but results were inconclusive for withdrawals due to adverse events and cancer to 24 months. TNF biologic monotherapy did not differ statistically significantly or clinically meaningfully from MTX for any of the outcomes (moderate‐quality evidence), and no data were available for non‐TNF biologic monotherapy. We conclude that biologic with MTX use in MTX‐naive populations is beneficial and that there is little/inconclusive evidence of harms. More data are needed for tofacitinib, radiographic progression and harms in this patient population to fully assess comparative efficacy and safety. Plain language summary Biologics for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in people not previously treated with methotrexate (MTX) Review question We studied the benefits and harms of biologics or tofacitinib on people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have not previously been treated with methotrexate (MTX), in trials done until June 2015. Data was available for four TNF biologics (adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) and two non‐TNF biologics (abatacept, rituximab). What is RA and what are biologics/tofacitinib? In RA, the immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the joint lining making it inflamed. Without treatment, the inflammation can lead to joint damage and disability. Biologics or tofacitinib are medications that can reduce joint inflammation/damage and improve symptoms. The review shows that in people with RA: ‐ Biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab) in combination with MTX probably improve signs and symptoms of RA (tender or swollen joints), the chances of RA remission (disappearance of symptoms) and probably slightly improve functional ability. We downgraded our confidence in the results because of concerns about the inconsistency of some results. ‐ Biologics in combination with MTX may make little or no difference in the risk of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. We downgraded our confidence in the results because of concerns about the inconsistency of some results and the lack of data. ‐ We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. Because of the lack of data, we are uncertain of the effect of biologics on the risk of cancer. ‐TNF biologics (adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab) alone (not in combination with MTX) probably make little or no difference in signs and symptoms of RA or chances of RA remission (no data for non‐TNF biologics alone). Best estimate of what happens to people with RA when taking biologics: ACR50 (American College of Rheumatology 50: number of tender or swollen joints, pain and disability)  : Biologic + MTX versus MTX:  56 people out of 100 who were on a biologic (in combination with MTX) experienced improvement in RA compared to 40 people out of 100 who were on MTX (16% improvement). Biologic monotherapy (TNF biologics) versus MTX:  35 people out of 100 who were on a biologic experienced improvement in RA compared to 37 people out of 100 who were on MTX (2% reduction) Remission (DAS <1.6 or DAS28 < 2.6) Biologic + MTX versus MTX:  37 people out of 100 who took a biologic (in combination with MTX) had their RA symptoms disappear compared to 22 people out of 100 who were on MTX (15% improvement). Biologic monotherapy (TNF biologics) versus MTX:  22 people out of 100 who took a biologic had their RA symptoms disappear compared to 20 people out of 100 who were on MTX (2% improvement). Progression of disease damage as measured on X‐rays (scale 0 to 448) Biologic + MTX versus MTX:  people who took a biologic (in combination with MTX) showed radiographic progression of 0.45 points compared to those on MTX who showed progression of 3 points (0.5% reduction). There were no studies for biologic monotherapy. Drug withdrawal due to adverse events Biologic + MTX versus MTX:  7 people out of 100 who took a biologic (in combination with MTX) withdrew from the study due to adverse events compared to 5 out of 100 participants who took MTX (2% more). Biologic monotherapy (TNF biologics) versus MTX:  6 people out of 100 who took a biologic withdrew from the study due to adverse events compared to 6 out of 100 participants who took MTX (0% difference). Serious adverse events Biologic + MTX versus MTX:  11 participants out of 100 who took a biologic (in combination with MTX) reported serious adverse events compared to 10 participants out of 100 on MTX (1% more serious adverse events). Biologic monotherapy (TNF biologics) versus MTX:  3 participants out of 100 who took a biologic reported serious adverse events compared to 7 participants out of 100 on MTX (4% fewer serious adverse events). Cancer The same number of people (1 out of 100) reported cancer for biologic (both alone and in combination with MTX) and the comparator MTX. However, there were few events of cancer so caution in this interpretation is needed.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Abatacept [therapeutic use]; Adalimumab [therapeutic use]; Adult; Antibodies, Monoclonal [therapeutic use]; Antirheumatic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis, Rheumatoid [*drug therapy]; Bayes Theorem; Biological Products [*therapeutic use]; Etanercept [therapeutic use]; Humans; Infliximab [therapeutic use]; Methotrexate [*therapeutic use]; Methylprednisolone [therapeutic use]; Network Meta‐Analysis; Piperidines [*therapeutic use]; Pyrimidines [*therapeutic use]; Pyrroles [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rituximab [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD012657","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012657","Musculoskeletal"
"CD011279.PUB3","Geneen, LJ; Moore, RA; Clarke, C; Martin, D; Colvin, LA; Smith, BH","Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults: an overview of Cochrane Reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Chronic pain is defined as pain lasting beyond normal tissue healing time, generally taken to be 12 weeks. It contributes to disability, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, and healthcare costs. Chronic pain has a weighted mean prevalence in adults of 20%. For many years, the treatment choice for chronic pain included recommendations for rest and inactivity. However, exercise may have specific benefits in reducing the severity of chronic pain, as well as more general benefits associated with improved overall physical and mental health, and physical functioning. Physical activity and exercise programmes are increasingly being promoted and offered in various healthcare systems, and for a variety of chronic pain conditions. It is therefore important at this stage to establish the efficacy and safety of these programmes, and furthermore to address the critical factors that determine their success or failure. Objectives To provide an overview of Cochrane Reviews of adults with chronic pain to determine (1) the effectiveness of different physical activity and exercise interventions in reducing pain severity and its impact on function, quality of life, and healthcare use; and (2) the evidence for any adverse effects or harm associated with physical activity and exercise interventions. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (CDSR) on the Cochrane Library (CDSR 2016, Issue 1) for systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), after which we tracked any included reviews for updates, and tracked protocols in case of full review publication until an arbitrary cut‐off date of 21 March 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue 3). We assessed the methodological quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR tool, and also planned to analyse data for each painful condition based on quality of the evidence. We extracted data for (1) self‐reported pain severity, (2) physical function (objectively or subjectively measured), (3) psychological function, (4) quality of life, (5) adherence to the prescribed intervention, (6) healthcare use/attendance, (7) adverse events, and (8) death. Due to the limited data available, we were unable to directly compare and analyse interventions, and have instead reported the evidence qualitatively. Main results We included 21 reviews with 381 included studies and 37,143 participants. Of these, 264 studies (19,642 participants) examined exercise versus no exercise/minimal intervention in adults with chronic pain and were used in the qualitative analysis. Pain conditions included rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain, intermittent claudication, dysmenorrhoea, mechanical neck disorder, spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome, and patellofemoral pain. None of the reviews assessed 'chronic pain' or 'chronic widespread pain' as a general term or specific condition. Interventions included aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion, and core or balance training programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi. Reviews were well performed and reported (based on AMSTAR), and included studies had acceptable risk of bias (with inadequate reporting of attrition and reporting biases). However the quality of evidence was low due to participant numbers (most included studies had fewer than 50 participants in total), length of intervention and follow‐up (rarely assessed beyond three to six months). We pooled the results from relevant reviews where appropriate, though results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence. Pain severity:  several reviews noted favourable results from exercise: only three reviews that reported pain severity found no statistically significant changes in usual or mean pain from any intervention. However, results were inconsistent across interventions and follow‐up, as exercise did not consistently bring about a change (positive or negative) in self‐reported pain scores at any single point. Physical function:  was the most commonly reported outcome measure. Physical function was significantly improved as a result of the intervention in 14 reviews, though even these statistically significant results had only small‐to‐moderate effect sizes (only one review reported large effect sizes). Psychological function and quality of life:  had variable results: results were either favourable to exercise (generally small and moderate effect size, with two reviews reporting significant, large effect sizes for quality of life), or showed no difference between groups. There were no negative effects. Adherence to the prescribed intervention:  could not be assessed in any review. However, risk of withdrawal/dropout was slightly higher in the exercising group (82.8/1000 participants versus 81/1000 participants), though the group difference was non‐significant. Healthcare use/attendance:  was not reported in any review. Adverse events, potential harm, and death:  only 25% of included studies (across 18 reviews) actively reported adverse events. Based on the available evidence, most adverse events were increased soreness or muscle pain, which reportedly subsided after a few weeks of the intervention. Only one review reported death separately to other adverse events: the intervention was protective against death (based on the available evidence), though did not reach statistical significance. Authors' conclusions The quality of the evidence examining physical activity and exercise for chronic pain is low. This is largely due to small sample sizes and potentially underpowered studies. A number of studies had adequately long interventions, but planned follow‐up was limited to less than one year in all but six reviews. There were some favourable effects in reduction in pain severity and improved physical function, though these were mostly of small‐to‐moderate effect, and were not consistent across the reviews. There were variable effects for psychological function and quality of life. The available evidence suggests physical activity and exercise is an intervention with few adverse events that may improve pain severity and physical function, and consequent quality of life. However, further research is required and should focus on increasing participant numbers, including participants with a broader spectrum of pain severity, and lengthening both the intervention itself, and the follow‐up period. Plain language summary Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults ‐ an overview of Cochrane Reviews Background Chronic (long‐term) pain is pain that has lasted beyond the body's usual healing time. It is often described as pain that has lasted for at least three months. Chronic pain causes many problems, beyond the pain itself, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and a poor quality of life. In the past, people with chronic pain were told to rest. However, general advice now is to keep active ‐ whether to affect the pain directly or to combat the other problems associated with it. Therefore, research studies have attempted to examine the effect of physical activity in people with chronic pain. This overview aimed to bring together and analyse any reviews published by Cochrane that looked at physical activity and exercise studies in any chronic pain condition, including arthritis, back and neck pain, and menstrual (period) pain. Key results and quality of the evidence In January 2016, we identified 21 Cochrane Reviews which covered 10 different diagnoses (osteoarthritis (a joint disease), rheumatoid arthritis (joint pain and swelling), fibromyalgia (widespread pain condition), low back pain, intermittent claudication (cramping pain in the legs), dysmenorrhoea (period pain), mechanical neck disorders (neck pain), spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome (a condition occurring in people who have had polio), patellofemoral pain (pain at the front of the knee)). The physical activity or exercise programme used in the trials ranged in frequency, intensity, and type, including land‐ and water‐based activities, those focusing on building strength, endurance, flexibility and range of motion, and muscle activation exercises. The quality of the evidence was low. This was mostly due to the small numbers of people with chronic pain who participated in each reviewed study. Ideally, a study should have hundreds of people assigned to each group, whereas most of the studies included in the review process here had fewer than 50 people in total. There was evidence that physical activity reduced the severity of pain, improved physical function, and had a variable effect on both psychological function and quality of life. However, these results were not found in all studies. The inconsistency could be due to the quality of the studies or because of the mix of different types of physical activity tested in the studies. Additionally, participants had predominantly mild‐to‐moderate pain, not moderate‐to‐severe pain. Conclusions According to the available evidence (only 25% of included studies reported on possible harm or injury from the intervention), physical activity did not cause harm. Muscle soreness that sometimes occurs with starting a new exercise subsided as the participants adapted to the new activities. This is important as it shows physical activity in general is acceptable and unlikely to cause harm in people with chronic pain, many of whom may have previously feared it would increase their pain further. Future studies should focus on increasing participant numbers, including a wider range of severity of pain (more people with more severe pain), and lengthening both the intervention (exercise programme) itself, and the follow‐up period. This pain is chronic in nature, and so a long‐term intervention, with longer periods of recovery or follow‐up, may be more effective.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Chronic Pain [mortality, psychology, *therapy]; Exercise Therapy [adverse effects, *methods]; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Myalgia [etiology]; Pain Measurement; Patient Compliance; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD011279.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011279.pub3","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

Our systematic review, standard meta‐analysis and network meta‐analysis (NMA) updates the 2009 Cochrane overview, 'Biologics for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)' and adds new data. This review is focused on biologic or tofacitinib therapy in people with RA who had previously been treated unsuccessfully with biologics. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) and small molecule tofacitinib versus comparator (placebo or methotrexate (MTX)/other DMARDs) in people with RA, previously unsuccessfully treated with biologics. Methods On 22 June 2015 we searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase; and trials registries (WHO trials register, Clinicaltrials.gov). We carried out article selection, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments in duplicate. We calculated direct estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using standard meta‐analysis. We used a Bayesian mixed treatment comparison (MTC) approach for NMA estimates with 95% credible intervals (CrI). We converted odds ratios (OR) to risk ratios (RR) for ease of understanding. We have also presented results in absolute measures as risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). Outcomes measured included four benefits (ACR50, function measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, remission defined as DAS < 1.6 or DAS28 < 2.6, slowing of radiographic progression) and three harms (withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and cancer). Main results This update includes nine new RCTs for a total of 12 RCTs that included 3364 participants. The comparator was placebo only in three RCTs (548 participants), MTX or other traditional DMARD in six RCTs (2468 participants), and another biologic in three RCTs (348 participants). Data were available for four tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐biologics: (certolizumab pegol (1 study; 37 participants), etanercept (3 studies; 348 participants), golimumab (1 study; 461 participants), infliximab (1 study; 27 participants)), three non‐TNF biologics (abatacept (3 studies; 632 participants), rituximab (2 studies; 1019 participants), and tocilizumab (2 studies; 589 participants)); there was only one study for tofacitinib (399 participants). The majority of the trials (10/12) lasted less than 12 months. We judged 33% of the studies at low risk of bias for allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, 25% had low risk of bias for attrition, 92% were at unclear risk for selective reporting; and 92% had low risk of bias for major baseline imbalance. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for most outcomes to moderate or low due to study limitations, heterogeneity, or rarity of direct comparator trials. Biologic monotherapy versus placebo Compared to placebo, biologics were associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in RA as demonstrated by higher ACR50 and RA remission rates. RR was 4.10 for ACR50 (95% CI 1.97 to 8.55; moderate‐quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 14% (95% CI 6% to 21%); and NNTB = 8 (95% CI 4 to 23). RR for RA remission was 13.51 (95% CI 1.85 to 98.45, one study available; moderate‐quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 9% (95% CI 5% to 13%); and NNTB = 11 (95% CI 3 to 136). Results for withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events did not show any statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences. There were no studies available for analysis for function measured by HAQ, radiographic progression, or cancer outcomes. There were not enough data for any of the outcomes to look at subgroups. Biologic + MTX versus active comparator (MTX/other traditional DMARDs) Compared to MTX/other traditional DMARDs, biologic + MTX was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in ACR50, function measured by HAQ, and RA remission rates in direct comparisons. RR for ACR50 was 4.07 (95% CI 2.76 to 5.99; high‐quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 16% (10% to 21%); NNTB = 7 (95% CI 5 to 11). HAQ scores showed an improvement with a mean difference (MD) of 0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.36; high‐quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 9.7% improvement (95% CI 7% to 12%); and NNTB = 5 (95% CI 4 to 7). Remission rates showed an improved RR of 20.73 (95% CI 4.13 to 104.16; moderate‐quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 10% (95% CI 8% to 13%); and NNTB = 17 (95% CI 4 to 96), among the biologic + MTX group compared to MTX/other DMARDs. There were no studies for radiographic progression. Results were not clinically meaningful or statistically significantly different for withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events, and were inconclusive for cancer. Tofacitinib monotherapy versus placebo There were no published data. Tofacitinib + MTX versus active comparator (MTX) In one study, compared to MTX, tofacitinib + MTX was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in ACR50 (RR 3.24; 95% CI 1.78 to 5.89; absolute benefit RD 19% (95% CI 12% to 26%); NNTB = 6 (95% CI 3 to 14); moderate‐quality evidence), and function measured by HAQ, MD 0.27 improvement (95% CI 0.14 to 0.39); absolute benefit RD 9% (95% CI 4.7% to 13%), NNTB = 5 (95% CI 4 to 10); high‐quality evidence). RA remission rates were not statistically significantly different but the observed difference may be clinically meaningful (RR 15.44 (95% CI 0.93 to 256.1; high‐quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%); NNTB could not be calculated. There were no studies for radiographic progression. There were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences for withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events, and results were inconclusive for cancer. Authors' conclusions Biologic (with or without MTX) or tofacitinib (with MTX) use was associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefits (ACR50, HAQ, remission) compared to placebo or an active comparator (MTX/other traditional DMARDs) among people with RA previously unsuccessfully treated with biologics. No studies examined radiographic progression. Results were not clinically meaningful or statistically significant for withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events, and were inconclusive for cancer. Plain language summary Biologics or tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis Review question We studied the effects of biologics on people with rheumtoid arthritis (RA), whose previous treatment with biologic therapy was unsuccessful, either due to lack of benefits or occurrence of side effects, or both. There were a total of 12 studies (up to June 2015) with data available for four of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐biologics (certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) and three of the non‐TNF biologics (abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab); only one study provided data for tofacitinib. What is RA and what are biologics/tofacitinib? In RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the joint lining making it inflamed. If the inflammation is untreated, joint damage and disability may result. Biologics and tofacitinib are medications that can reduce joint inflammation, improve symptoms and prevent some of the joint damage. The review shows that in people with RA: ‐ Biologics alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), a disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drug (DMARD), improve signs (tender or swollen joints) and symptoms of RA, function, and probably improve the chances of RA remission (disappearance of symptoms), based on high‐ and moderate‐quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision). ‐ Tofacitinib in combination with MTX, probably improves signs and symptoms of RA (tender or swollen joints) and function, based on high‐ and moderate‐quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision). ‐ We often do not have precise information about side‐effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side‐effects. Because of the lack of data and low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of biologics and tofacitinib on the risk of cancer, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Best estimate of what happens to people with RA when taking biologics or tofacitinib: ACR50 (number of tender or swollen joints, pain, and disability) Biologic monotherapy versus placebo : 18 out of 100 people on a biologic monotherapy experienced improvement in their symptoms versus 4 out of 100 on placebo (14% absolute improvement). Biologic + MTX versus MTX/other traditional DMARDs : 21 people out of 100 on biologic + MTX experienced improvement in RA symptoms compared to 5 people out of 100 who were on MTX/DMARD (16% absolute improvement). Tofacitinib + MTX versus MTX : 28 people out of 100 on tofacitinib + MTX experienced improvement in RA symptoms compared to 9 people out of 100 who were on MTX/DMARD (19% absolute improvement), based on one study. Remission (DAS < 1.6 or DAS28 < 2.6) Biologic monotherapy versus placebo : 102 people out of 1000 who were on biologic had their RA symptoms disappear compared to 8 people out of 1000 on placebo (9% absolute improvement). Biologic + MTX versus MTX/other traditional DMARDs:  104 people out of 1000 who were on biologic + MTX had their RA symptoms disappear compared to 3 people out of 1000 who were on MTX/DMARD (10% absolute improvement). Tofacitinib + MTX versus MTX : 56 people out of 1000 who were on tofacitinib + MTX had their RA symptoms disappear compared to 0 people out of 1000 who were on MTX/DMARD (6% absolute improvement), based on one study. Progression of radiographic destruction No studies were available for analysis. Drug withdrawal due to adverse events Biologic monotherapy versus placebo : 32 people out of 1000 on biologic reported withdrawal due to adverse events versus 42 out of 1000 on placebo (1% fewer withdrawals). Biologic + MTX versus MTX/other traditional DMARDs : 38 people out of 1000 on biologic + MTX reported withdrawal due to adverse events compared to 8 out of 1000 people on MTX/DMARD (5% more withdrawals). Tofacitinib + MTX versus MTX : there was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between people on tofacitinib + MTX and people on MTX/DMARD, both with 5 participants out of 100, based on one study. Serious  a dverse events There was a 1% to 3% difference for fewer serious adverse events in all comparisons compared with people on MTX/DMARD. Cancer Biologic + MTX versus MTX/other traditional DMARDs : there was a less than 1% difference for the risk of cancer between biologic + MTX and MTX/DMARD; 5 out of 1000 of those on biologic + MTX and 0 on MTX/DMARD developed cancer, although there were very few studies available.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Antirheumatic Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Arthritis, Rheumatoid [diagnostic imaging, *therapy]; Bayes Theorem; Biological Products [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Disease Progression; Humans; Methotrexate [therapeutic use]; Neoplasms [etiology]; Network Meta‐Analysis; Piperidines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Protein Kinase Inhibitors [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Pyrimidines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Pyrroles [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Treatment Failure","10.1002/14651858.CD012591","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012591","Musculoskeletal"
"CD012103.PUB2","Mourad, S; Brown, J; Farquhar, C","Interventions for the prevention of OHSS in ART cycles: an overview of Cochrane reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles is a treatment‐induced disease that has an estimated prevalence of 20% to 33% in its mild form and 3% to 8% in its moderate or severe form. These numbers might even be higher for high‐risk women such as those with polycystic ovaries or a high oocyte yield from ovum pickup. Objectives The objective of this overview is to identify and summarise all evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions for prevention or treatment of moderate, severe and overall OHSS in couples with subfertility who are undergoing ART cycles. Methods Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting on moderate, severe or overall OHSS as an outcome in ART cycles were eligible for inclusion in this overview. We also identified Cochrane submitted protocols and title registrations for future inclusion in the overview. The evidence is current to 12 December 2016. We identified reviews, protocols and titles by searching the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in July 2016 on the effectiveness of interventions for outcomes of moderate, severe and overall OHSS. We undertook in duplicate selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment. We used the AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) tool to assess the quality of included reviews, and we used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. We summarised the characteristics of included reviews in the text and in additional tables. Main results We included a total of 27 reviews in this overview. The reviews were generally of high quality according to AMSTAR ratings, and included studies provided evidence that ranged from very low to high in quality. Ten reviews had not been updated in the past three years. Seven reviews described interventions that provided a beneficial effect in reducing OHSS rates, and we categorised one additional review as 'promising'. Of the effective interventions, all except one had no detrimental effect on pregnancy outcomes. Evidence of at least moderate quality  indicates that clinicians should consider the following interventions in ART cycles to reduce OHSS rates. • Metformin treatment before and during an ART cycle for women with PCOS (moderate‐quality evidence). • Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in ART cycles (moderate‐quality evidence). • GnRH agonist (GnRHa) trigger in donor oocyte or 'freeze‐all' programmes (moderate‐quality evidence). Evidence of low or very low quality  suggests that clinicians should consider the following interventions in ART cycles to reduce OHSS rates. • Clomiphene citrate for controlled ovarian stimulation in ART cycles (low‐quality evidence). • Cabergoline around the time of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration or oocyte pickup in ART cycles (low‐quality evidence). • Intravenous fluids (plasma expanders) around the time of hCG administration or oocyte pickup in ART cycles (very low‐quality evidence). • Progesterone for luteal phase support in ART cycles (low‐quality evidence). • Coasting (withholding gonadotrophins) ‐ a promising intervention that needs to be researched further for reduction of OHSS. On the basis of this overview, we must conclude that evidence is currently insufficient to support the widespread practice of embryo cryopreservation. Authors' conclusions Currently, 27 reviews in the Cochrane Library were conducted to report on or to try to report on OHSS in ART cycles. We identified four review protocols but no new registered titles that can potentially be included in this overview in the future. This overview provides the most up‐to‐date evidence on prevention of OHSS in ART cycles from all currently published Cochrane reviews on ART. Clinicians can use the evidence summarised in this overview to choose the best treatment regimen for individual patients ‐ a regimen that not only reduces the chance of developing OHSS but does not compromise other outcomes such as pregnancy or live birth rate. Review results, however, are limited by the lack of recent primary studies or updated reviews. Furthermore, this overview can be used by policymakers in developing local and regional protocols or guidelines and can reveal knowledge gaps for future research. Plain language summary Interventions for prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in in vitro fertilisation cycles: an overview of Cochrane reviews Overview question This overview of Cochrane reviews aims to identify and summarise all evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions that could prevent or treat moderate, severe and overall ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in couples with subfertility who are undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles (i.e. in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)). Background OHSS in ART cycles is an adverse event that follows ovarian stimulation for IVF. It is caused by a very high ovarian response to hormonal medication and results in enlarged ovaries and a fluid shift from blood vessels to the abdominal cavity, resulting in, for example, abdominal bloating, high risk of clots within the blood vessels (thrombosis) and decreased blood supply to important organs such as kidneys and liver. The mild form of OHSS is seen in almost 20% to 33% of cycles, whereas a moderate or severe form is found in approximately 3% to 8% of cycles and can lead to serious disease burden or even mortality if left untreated. It is therefore important to identify treatment regimens and interventions that can reduce the incidence of OHSS. Study characteristics We found a total of 27 Cochrane ART reviews of high quality that could be included for this overview. These reviews aimed to report on OHSS in cycles of IVF or ICSI. We did not include reviews of intrauterine insemination and ovulation induction. The evidence is current to 12 December 2016. Key results Of the 27 reviews included in this overview, 10 reviews had not been updated in the past three years. Seven reviews described interventions that provided a beneficial effect in reducing OHSS rates, and we categorised one additional review as 'promising'. Of the effective interventions, all except one had no detrimental effect on pregnancy outcomes.  Evidence of at least moderate quality evidence  indicates that clinicians should consider the following interventions in ART cycles to reduce OHSS rates. • Metformin treatment before and during an ART cycle in women with PCOS (moderate‐quality evidence). • Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in ART cycles (moderate‐quality evidence). • GnRH agonist (GnRHa) trigger in donor oocyte or 'freeze‐all' programmes (moderate‐quality evidence). Evidence of low or very low quality evidence  suggests that clinicians should consider the following interventions in ART cycles to reduce OHSS rates. • Clomiphene citrate for controlled ovarian stimulation in ART cycles (low‐quality evidence). • Cabergoline around the time of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration or oocyte pickup in ART cycles (low‐quality evidence). • Intravenous fluids (blood plasma expanders) around the time of hCG administration or egg pickup in ART cycles (very low‐quality evidence). • Progesterone for luteal phase support in ART cycles (low‐quality evidence). A promising intervention that needs to be researched further is coasting (withholding gonadotrophins) for reduction of OHSS. On the basis of this overview, we must conclude that evidence is currently insufficient to support the widespread practice of freezing all embryos and replacing them at a later time when OHSS has dissolved. Clinicians can use the evidence summarised in this overview to choose the best treatment regimen for individual patients ‐ a regimen that not only reduces the chance of developing OHSS but does not compromise pregnancy outcomes. However, results of this overview are limited by the lack of recent primary studies or updated reviews. Furthermore, this overview can be used by policymakers in developing local and regional protocols or guidelines and can reveal knowledge gaps for future research.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cabergoline; Ergolines [therapeutic use]; Female; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone [agonists, therapeutic use]; Humans; Metformin [therapeutic use]; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome [etiology, *prevention & control, therapy]; Pregnancy; Progesterone [therapeutic use]; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted [*adverse effects]; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012103.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012103.pub2","Gynaecology and Fertility"

The symptoms are due to autoimmune inflammation of peripheral nerves. CIPD affects about 2 to 3 per 100,000 of the population. More than half of affected people cannot walk unaided when symptoms are at their worst. CIDP usually responds to treatments that reduce inflammation, but there is disagreement about which treatment is most effective. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) and non‐Cochrane systematic reviews of any treatment for CIDP and to compare the effects of treatments. Methods We considered all systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment for any form of CIDP. We reported their primary outcomes, giving priority to change in disability after 12 months. Two overview authors independently identified published systematic reviews for inclusion and collected data. We reported the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. Two other review authors independently checked review selection, data extraction and quality assessments. On 31 October 2016, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (in the Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus for systematic reviews of CIDP. We supplemented the RCTs in the existing CSRs by searching on the same date for RCTs of any treatment of CIDP (including treatment of fatigue or pain in CIDP), in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus. Main results Five CSRs met our inclusion criteria. We identified 23 randomised trials, of which 15 had been included in these CSRs. We were unable to compare treatments as originally planned, because outcomes and outcome intervals differed. Corticosteroids It is uncertain whether daily oral prednisone improved impairment compared to no treatment because the quality of the evidence was very low (1 trial, 28 participants). According to moderate‐quality evidence (1 trial, 41 participants), six months' treatment with high‐dose monthly oral dexamethasone did not improve disability more than daily oral prednisolone. Observational studies tell us that prolonged use of corticosteroids sometimes causes serious side‐effects. Plasma exchange According to moderate‐quality evidence (2 trials, 59 participants), twice‐weekly plasma exchange produced more short‐term improvement in disability than sham exchange. In the largest observational study, 3.9% of plasma exchange procedures had complications. Intravenous immunoglobulin According to high‐quality evidence (5 trials, 269 participants), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) produced more short‐term improvement than placebo. Adverse events were more common with IVIg than placebo (high‐quality evidence), but serious adverse events were not (moderate‐quality evidence, 3 trials, 315 participants). One trial with 19 participants provided moderate‐quality evidence of little or no difference in short‐term improvement of impairment with plasma exchange in comparison to IVIg. There was little or no difference in short‐term improvement of disability with IVIg in comparison to oral prednisolone (moderate‐quality evidence; 1 trial, 29 participants) or intravenous methylprednisolone (high‐quality evidence; 1 trial, 45 participants). One unpublished randomised open trial with 35 participants found little or no difference in disability after three months of IVIg compared to oral prednisone; this trial has not yet been included in a CSR. We know from observational studies that serious adverse events related to IVIg do occur. Other immunomodulatory treatments It is uncertain whether the addition of azathioprine (2 mg/kg) to prednisone improved impairment in comparison to prednisone alone, as the quality of the evidence is very low (1 trial, 27 participants). Observational studies show that adverse effects truncate treatment in 10% of people. According to low‐quality evidence (1 trial, 60 participants), compared to placebo, methotrexate 15 mg/kg did not allow more participants to reduce corticosteroid or IVIg doses by 20%. Serious adverse events were no more common with methotrexate than with placebo, but observational studies show that methotrexate can cause teratogenicity, abnormal liver function, and pulmonary fibrosis. According to moderate‐quality evidence (2 trials, 77 participants), interferon beta‐1a (IFN beta‐1a) in comparison to placebo, did not allow more people to withdraw from IVIg. According to moderate‐quality evidence, serious adverse events were no more common with IFN beta‐1a than with placebo. We know of no other completed trials of immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory agents for CIDP. Other treatments We identified no trials of treatments for fatigue or pain in CIDP. Adverse effects Not all trials routinely collected adverse event data; when they did, the quality of evidence was variable. Adverse effects in the short, medium, and long term occur with all interventions. We are not able to make reliable comparisons of adverse events between the interventions included in CSRs. Authors' conclusions We cannot be certain based on available evidence whether daily oral prednisone improves impairment compared to no treatment. However, corticosteroids are commonly used, based on widespread availability, low cost, very low‐quality evidence from observational studies, and clinical experience. The weakness of the evidence does not necessarily mean that corticosteroids are ineffective. High‐dose monthly oral dexamethasone for six months is probably no more or less effective than daily oral prednisolone. Plasma exchange produces short‐term improvement in impairment as determined by neurological examination, and probably produces short‐term improvement in disability. IVIg produces more short‐term improvement in disability than placebo and more adverse events, although serious side effects are probably no more common than with placebo. There is no clear difference in short‐term improvement in impairment with IVIg when compared with intravenous methylprednisolone and probably no improvement when compared with either oral prednisolone or plasma exchange. According to observational studies, adverse events related to difficult venous access, use of citrate, and haemodynamic changes occur in 3% to17% of plasma exchange procedures. It is uncertain whether azathioprine is of benefit as the quality of evidence is very low. Methotrexate may not be of benefit and IFN beta‐1a is probably not of benefit. We need further research to identify predictors of response to different treatments and to compare their long‐term benefits, safety and cost‐effectiveness. There is a need for more randomised trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, routes of administration, and treatments for symptoms of CIDP. Plain language summary Overview of all systematic review of all treatments for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) Review question What can we learn from summarising the evidence from systematic reviews on treatments for  C hronic  I nflammatory  D emyelinating  P olyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)? Is any treatment more or less effective and safe than another? Background CIDP is a long‐term condition, in which symptoms can steadily worsen over time or show periods of improvement and relapse. People usually have weakness and numbness due to inflammation of nerves (nerves affected are outside the spinal cord and brain). CIDP affects about 2 to 3 per 100,000 of the population and can be disabling. More than half of affected people cannot walk unaided when symptoms are at their worst. Treatments directed at reducing the inflammation usually help but there is no clear evidence favouring one commonly used treatment over another. Methods We searched five databases for all systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) until October 2016. We judged that five Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) provided the best evidence and identified 23 randomised trials, of which 16 have so far been included in CSRs. We assessed the quality of their included evidence. Key results and quality of the evidence The evidence from randomised trials is as follows. 1. It is uncertain whether daily oral prednisone (an anti‐inflammatory corticosteroid) improved weakness and sensation (numbness) compared to no treatment, as the evidence is of very low quality. We know that corticosteroids have a significant risk of serious side effects during prolonged use. 2. High‐dose monthly oral dexamethasone (a more powerful corticosteroid) for six months was probably no more or less effective than daily oral prednisolone. 3. Plasma exchange probably produced significantly more short‐term improvement in disability than dummy exchange. In the largest observational study, 3.9% of plasma exchange procedures had complications. 4. IVIg produced significantly more short‐term improvement in disability than placebo. Adverse events were more common with IVIg than placebo but serious adverse events were probably no more common than with placebo. Other, lower‐quality studies, not eligible for inclusion here, report that serious adverse effects can occur with IVIg. 5. There was no clear difference in short‐term improvement of impairment with plasma exchange as compared to IVIg. 6. There was probably little or no difference in short‐term improvement of disability with IVIg in comparison to oral prednisolone and there was little or no difference in comparison to intravenous methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are much more widely available than IVIg, and are cheaper and easier to use. 7. It is uncertain whether low‐dose azathioprine added to prednisone improved impairment over prednisone alone, because the quality of evidence is very low. Adverse events were not reported but observational studies show that side effects prevent 10% of people from continuing treatment. 8. Methotrexate may have no benefit over placebo in number of participants able to reduce their corticosteroid or IVIg dose by 20%. Serious adverse events were probably no more common with methotrexate than with placebo. We know from other types of study that methotrexate has serious side‐effects, including damage to fetuses, liver function abnormalities and scarring of the lung. 9. Interferon beta‐1a (IFN beta‐1a), compared to placebo, probably does not allow more people to withdraw from IVIg. Serious adverse events were probably no more common with IFN beta‐1a than with placebo in the two studies of this intervention. 10. There have been no other completed trials of medicines that suppress or change immune responses or that treat fatigue or pain in CIDP. We need further research on predictors of response to different treatments, on long‐term benefits, and of cost‐effectiveness. We need more RCTs of medicines that suppress or change immune responses and treat symptoms of pain and fatigue in CIDP, and better ways to collect information on adverse events.

Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews of all symptomatic treatments for MND. Methods We searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (CDSR) on 15 November 2016 for systematic reviews of symptomatic treatments for MND. We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables. Main results We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non‐RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for pain There is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for cramps There is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo: – memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate‐quality evidence); – vitamin E may have little or no effect (low‐quality evidence); and – the effects of L‐threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data. The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticity It is uncertain whether an endurance‐based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison ""usual activities"", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory function Non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate‐quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy‐assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoea A single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate‐quality evidence from 1 placebo‐controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutrition There is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation It is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exercise There is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with ""usual activities"" or ""usual care"" including stretching (2 RCTs, low‐quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary care There is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND. None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting. Authors' conclusions This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo‐controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo‐controlled RCTs in these areas. We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs—of people with MND and their caregivers—associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life). Plain language summary Managing symptoms in motor neuron disease Review question What are the effects of treatments for managing symptoms in motor neuron disease (MND)? Background Motor neuron disease (MND), which is also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is an uncommon, incurable disease that affects the nerves involved in movement. MND gets worse over time and affects muscles of the limbs, speech, swallowing and breathing. People with MND experience a wide range of symptoms, including a number of physical ability limitations, pain, spasticity, cramps, swallowing problems and difficulty breathing. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to show that a treatment is effective for several reasons that are not related to the effects of the treatment itself, for example when there are too few people in a trial, or investigators choose an ineffective dose of a drug. Review characteristics We searched for Cochrane Systematic Reviews of treatments aiming to manage symptoms of MND. We found nine reviews that fitted the objectives of this study. These reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for pain, cramps, spasticity, and sialorrhoea, and assessed the effects of mechanical ventilation (non‐invasive ventilation), enteral tube feeding, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), therapeutic exercise, and multidisciplinary care. The trials compared the treatment with an inactive treatment (placebo drug or sham therapy) or usual care. Key results and quality of the evidence There are currently many treatments in clinical use for pain, but no robust information currently exists on their effectiveness in people with MND. There is evidence that memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol are probably ineffective for cramps in ALS and that vitamin E may be ineffective. There is too little information from RCTs on the effects of other treatments studied, including L‐threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen. The review did not report adverse events other than for riluzole. It is uncertain whether exercise improves muscle stiffness (spasticity). Exercise may improve disability; it may not improve quality of life. Other interventions for spasticity have not been studied in RCTs. Non‐invasive mechanical ventilation probably improves survival and quality of life in ALS; it may not improve survival in people with poor bulbar function. The review did not assess when to start NIV. A single session of botulinum toxin injections into the salivary glands probably improves excessive saliva production and dribbling, and quality of life in the short term (over weeks but not months). At present, there is no evidence available from controlled trials to indicate whether or not there is a benefit to tube feeding for supporting nutrition, nor is there any evidence to indicate whether multidisciplinary care is helpful or harmful. It is uncertain whether rTMS is of benefit for improving disability or activity limitation in MND. Lack of evidence on multidisciplinary care or other treatments, however, should not be interpreted as ineffectiveness. Only the cramps review reported that adverse events occurred. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse events or rule out uncommon events. More research is required to determine which treatments help to manage symptoms for those living with MND, using suitable types of studies and outcome measures.

This review is focused on biologic monotherapy in people with RA in whom treatment with traditional disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) had failed (MTX/other DMARD‐experienced). Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of biologic monotherapy (includes anti‐tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) or non‐TNF (abatacept, anakinra, rituximab, tocilizumab)) or tofacitinib monotherapy (oral small molecule) versus comparator (placebo or MTX/other DMARDs) in adults with RA who were MTX/other DMARD‐experienced. Methods We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;  The Cochrane Library  2015, Issue 6, June), MEDLINE (via OVID 1946 to June 2015), and Embase (via OVID 1947 to June 2015). Article selection, data extraction and risk of bias and GRADE assessments were done in duplicate. We calculated direct estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using standard meta‐analysis. We used a Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) approach for NMA estimates with 95% credible intervals (CrI). We converted odds ratios (OR) to risk ratios (RR) for ease of understanding. We calculated absolute measures as risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). Main results This update includes 40 new RCTs for a total of 46 RCTs, of which 41 studies with 14,049 participants provided data. The comparator was placebo in 16 RCTs (4,532 patients), MTX or other DMARD in 13 RCTs (5,602 patients), and another biologic in 12 RCTs (3,915 patients). Monotherapy versus placebo Based on moderate‐quality direct evidence, biologic monotherapy (without concurrent MTX/other DMARDs) was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in American College of Rheumatology score (ACR50) and physical function, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) versus placebo. RR was 4.68 for ACR50 (95% CI, 2.93 to 7.48); absolute benefit RD 23% (95% CI, 18% to 29%); and NNTB = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8). The mean difference (MD) was ‐0.32 for HAQ (95% CI, ‐0.42 to ‐0.23; a negative sign represents greater HAQ improvement); absolute benefit of ‐10.7% (95% CI, ‐14% to ‐7.7%); and NNTB = 4 (95% CI, 3 to 5). Direct and NMA estimates for TNF biologic, non‐TNF biologic or tofacitinib monotherapy showed similar results for ACR50 , downgraded to moderate‐quality evidence. Direct and NMA estimates for TNF biologic, anakinra or tofacitinib monotherapy showed a similar results for HAQ versus placebo with mostly moderate quality evidence. Based on moderate‐quality direct evidence, biologic monotherapy was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant greater proportion of disease remission versus placebo with RR 1.12 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.22); absolute benefit 10% (95% CI, 3% to 17%; NNTB = 10 (95% CI, 8 to 21)). Based on low‐quality direct evidence, results for biologic monotherapy for withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events were inconclusive, with wide confidence intervals encompassing the null effect and evidence of an important increase. The direct estimate for TNF monotherapy for withdrawals due to adverse events showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant result with RR 2.02 (95% CI, 1.08 to 3.78), absolute benefit RD 3% (95% CI,1% to 4%), based on moderate‐quality evidence. The NMA estimates for TNF biologic, non‐TNF biologic, anakinra, or tofacitinib monotherapy for withdrawals due to adverse events and for serious adverse events were all inconclusive and downgraded to low‐quality evidence. Monotherapy versus active comparator (MTX/other DMARDs) Based on direct evidence of moderate quality, biologic monotherapy (without concurrent MTX/other DMARDs) was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in ACR50 and HAQ scores versus MTX/other DMARDs with a RR of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.14 to 2.08); absolute benefit 13% (95% CI, 2% to 23%), NNTB = 7 (95% CI, 4 to 26) and a mean difference in HAQ of ‐0.27 (95% CI, ‐0.40 to ‐0.14); absolute benefit of ‐9% (95% CI, ‐13.3% to ‐4.7%), NNTB = 2 (95% CI, 2 to 4). Direct and NMA estimates for TNF monotherapy and NMA estimate for non‐TNF biologic monotherapy for ACR50 showed similar results, based on moderate‐quality evidence. Direct and NMA estimates for non‐TNF biologic monotherapy, but not TNF monotherapy, showed similar HAQ improvements , based on mostly moderate‐quality evidence. There were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences for direct estimates of biologic monotherapy versus active comparator for RA disease remission. NMA estimates showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference versus active comparator for TNF monotherapy (absolute improvement 7% (95% CI, 2% to 14%)) and non‐TNF monotherapy (absolute improvement 19% (95% CrI, 7% to 36%)), both downgraded to moderate quality. Based on moderate‐quality direct evidence from a single study, radiographic progression (scale 0 to 448) was statistically significantly reduced in those on biologic monotherapy versus active comparator, MD ‐4.34 (95% CI, ‐7.56 to ‐1.12), though the absolute reduction was small, ‐0.97% (95% CI, ‐1.69% to ‐0.25%). We are not sure of the clinical relevance of this reduction. Direct and NMA evidence (downgraded to low quality), showed inconclusive results for withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events and cancer, with wide confidence intervals encompassing the null effect and evidence of an important increase. Authors' conclusions Based mostly on RCTs of six to 12‐month duration in people with RA who had previously experienced and failed treatment with MTX/other DMARDs, biologic monotherapy improved ACR50, function and RA remission rates compared to placebo or MTX/other DMARDs. Radiographic progression was reduced versus active comparator, although the clinical significance was unclear. Results were inconclusive for whether biologic monotherapy was associated with an increased risk of withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events or cancer, versus placebo (no data on cancer) or MTX/other DMARDs. Plain language summary Biologics or tofacitinib alone for people with rheumatoid arthritis who had not improved with traditional disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs In people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the joint lining making joints inflamed, swollen, stiff and painful. We looked for trials of biologics (large molecules administered by injection) or tofacitinib (small molecules given by mouth) in people with RA. The review shows that in people with RA  compared to salt water (placebo) or traditional drugs such as MTX/other DMARDs, biologic monotherapy (without MTX/other DMARDs) improves or probably improves signs and symptoms of RA (tender or swollen joints), function and chances of RA remission (disappearance of symptoms). Compared to salt water (placebo) or MTX/other DMARDs, biologic monotherapy may increase slightly or make no difference to the number of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. In the short‐term evidence summarised here, biologic monotherapy does not increase the risk of cancer compared to MTX/other DMARDs. Best estimate of what happens to people with RA taking biologic monotherapy Monotherapy versus placebo RA Symptoms 29 people out of 100 on biologic monotherapy experienced improvement compared to 6 people out of 100 who were on placebo, that is 23 more people out of 100 (23% absolute improvement). Function improvement by Health Assessment Questionnaire People who took biologic monotherapy rated that their function improved by 0.46 points on a scale of 0 to 3 compared to 0.14 points by people who took placebo, that is 0.32 points more (11% absolute improvement). Remission 95 people out of 100 had disappearance of all symptoms of their RA compared to 85 people out of 100 who were on placebo, that is 10 more people out of 100 (10% absolute improvement). Progression of disease damage as measured on X‐rays (on a scale of 0 to 448) No studies provided data on this comparison. Withdrawal from study due to adverse events 52 people out of 1000 who took biologic monotherapy withdrew from the study compared to 32 people out of 1000 who were on placebo, that is 20 more people out of 1000 (2% more withdrawals). Serious Adverse Events 92 people out of 1000 who took biologic monotherapy had serious adverse events (most commonly infections) compared to 72 people out of 1000 who were on placebo, that is 20 more people out of 1000 (2% more withdrawals). Cancer No studies provided data on this comparison. Monotherapy versus other traditional drugs (MTX/other DMARDs) RA Symptoms 42 people out of 100 who were on biologic monotherapy experienced improvement compared to 29 people out of 100 who were on MTX/other DMARDs, that is 13 more people out of 100 (13% absolute improvement) . Function improvement by Health Assessment Questionnaire People who took biologic monotherapy rated that their function improved by 0.43 points compared to people who took MTX/other DMARDs, whose function improved by 0.16 points on a scale of 0 to 3, that is 0.27 points (9% absolute improvement). Remission 21 people out of 100 had disappearance of all symptoms of their RA compared to 15 people out of 100 who were on MTX/other DMARDs, that is 6 more people out of 100 (6% absolute improvement). Progression of disease damage as measured on X‐rays (on a scale of 0 to 448) The damage to joints of people on biologic monotherapy was 1.6 points compared to 5.9 points for people who took MTX/other DMARDs, that is 4.3 points lower (‐0.97% absolute improvement). Withdrawal from study due to adverse events 80 people out of 1000 who took biologic monotherapy withdrew from the study compared to 70 people out of 1000 who were on MTX/other DMARDs, that is 10 more people out of 1000 (1% more withdrawals). Serious Adverse Events 79 people out of 1000 who took biologic monotherapy had serious adverse events compared to 49 people out of 1000 who were on MTX/other DMARDs, that is 30 more people out of 1000 (3% more withdrawals). Cancer The same number of people (1 out of 1000) who took biologic monotherapy compared to those on MTX/other DMARDs had cancer. However, we are cautious about this estimate as there were few events of cancer.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Antibodies, Monoclonal [therapeutic use]; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized [therapeutic use]; Antirheumatic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis, Rheumatoid [drug therapy]; Biological Products [*therapeutic use]; Certolizumab Pegol [therapeutic use]; Disease Progression; Etanercept [therapeutic use]; Humans; Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein [therapeutic use]; Methotrexate [therapeutic use]; Network Meta‐Analysis; Piperidines [*therapeutic use]; Pyrimidines [*therapeutic use]; Pyrroles [*therapeutic use]; Rituximab [therapeutic use]; Treatment Failure","10.1002/14651858.CD012437","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012437","Musculoskeletal"

Objectives To compare methotrexate and methotrexate‐based DMARD combinations for rheumatoid arthritis in patients naïve to or with an inadequate response (IR) to methotrexate. Methods We systematically identified all randomised controlled trials with methotrexate monotherapy or in combination with any currently used conventional synthetic DMARD , biologic DMARDs, or tofacitinib. Three major outcomes (ACR50 response, radiographic progression and withdrawals due to adverse events) and multiple minor outcomes were evaluated. Treatment effects were summarized using Bayesian random‐effects network meta‐analyses, separately for methotrexate‐naïve and methotrexate‐IR trials. Heterogeneity was explored through meta‐regression and subgroup analyses. The risk of bias of each trial was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and trials at high risk of bias were excluded from the main analysis. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. A comparison between two treatments was considered statistically significant if its credible interval excluded the null effect, indicating >97.5% probability that one treatment was superior. Main results 158 trials with over 37,000 patients were included. Methotrexate‐naïve: Several treatment combinations with methotrexate were statistically superior to oral methotrexate for ACR50 response: methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine (“triple therapy”), methotrexate + several biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab), and tofacitinib. The estimated probability of ACR50 response was similar between these treatments (range 56‐67%, moderate to high quality evidence), compared with 41% for methotrexate. Methotrexate combined with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, or infliximab was statistically superior to oral methotrexate for inhibiting radiographic progression (moderate to high quality evidence) but the estimated mean change over one year with all treatments was less than the minimal clinically important difference of five units on the Sharp‐van der Heijde scale. Methotrexate + azathioprine had statistically more withdrawals due to adverse events than oral methotrexate, and triple therapy had statistically fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than methotrexate + infliximab (rate ratio 0.26, 95% credible interval: 0.06 to 0.91). Methotrexate‐inadequate response: In patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, several treatments were statistically significantly superior to oral methotrexate for ACR50 response: triple therapy (moderate quality evidence), methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine (low quality evidence), methotrexate + leflunomide (moderate quality evidence), methotrexate + intramuscular gold (very low quality evidence), methotrexate + most biologics (moderate to high quality evidence), and methotrexate + tofacitinib (high quality evidence). There was a 61% probability of an ACR50 response with triple therapy, compared to a range of 27% to 64% for the combinations of methotrexate + biologic DMARDs that were statistically significantly superior to oral methotrexate. No treatment was statistically significantly superior to oral methotrexate for inhibiting radiographic progression. Methotrexate + cyclosporine and methotrexate + tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) had a statistically higher rate of withdrawals due to adverse events than oral methotrexate and methotrexate + abatacept had a statistically lower rate of withdrawals due to adverse events than several treatments. Authors' conclusions We found moderate to high quality evidence that combination therapy with methotrexate + sulfasalazine+ hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) or methotrexate + most biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib were similarly effective in controlling disease activity and generally well tolerated in methotrexate‐naïve patients or after an inadequate response to methotrexate. Methotrexate + some biologic DMARDs were superior to methotrexate in preventing joint damage in methotrexate‐naïve patients, but the magnitude of these effects was small over one year. Plain language summary Methotrexate alone or in combination with other medications for rheumatoid arthritis Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of methotrexate either taken alone or with other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with rheumatoid arthritis. After searching for all relevant studies up to January 19, 2016, they found 158 studies with over 37,000 people. These studies were published between 1985 and 2016 and were between 12 weeks and 2 years in duration. Their findings are summarised below: In people with rheumatoid arthritis, compared to taking methotrexate alone: ‐The combination of methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate + most biologic DMARDs improves disease activity. Other treatment combinations (methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate + leflunomide, methotrexate + gold injections) may improve disease activity in people who do not respond to methotrexate alone. ‐The combinations of methotrexate + several biologic DMARDs (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, or infliximab) reduces joint damage (as seen on x‐rays) slightly over one year in patients who have not taken methotrexate before. ‐The combinations of methotrexate + azathioprine, methotrexate + cyclosporine and methotrexate + tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) probably increases the chance of stopping the medication due to a side effect. What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is methotrexate and other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs? When you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. There is no cure for RA at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. Fortunately, there are many medications that can control the disease effectively. These medications are known as disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs. Methotrexate is widely regarded as the preferred DMARD for most patients with RA as it works well for most patients and is generally well tolerated. Methotrexate can be used by itself or can be combined with other DMARDs. These other DMARDs include medications that have been available and used for many years (such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine), as well as newer more expensive treatments (biologic DMARDs and tofacitinib). It is important to understand how all of these treatments compare in terms of the benefits and side effects. What happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate combined with other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs? A) People who  have not  taken methotrexate before: ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability) ‐61 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and 56 to 67 people out of 100 who took methotrexate + biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib experienced improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis, compared to 41 out of 100 people who took methotrexate alone. X‐rays of the joints: ‐People who took methotrexate combined with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, or infliximab had a small reduction in the progression of joint damage (Sharp‐van der Heijde score) over one year compared to oral methotrexate, but the estimated amount of damage even with oral methotrexate was very small (2.6 point increase). Stopping the medication due to a side effect ‐36 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + azathioprine had to stop the medication due to a side effect, compared to 8 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone. B) People who  have  taken methotrexate before: ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability) ‐61 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and 27 to 64 people out of 100 who took methotrexate + biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib experienced improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis, compared to 13 out of 100 people who took methotrexate alone. X‐rays of the joints: ‐No treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of joint damage seen on x‐rays over one year. Stopping the medication due to a side effect ‐21 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + cyclosporine and 12 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) had to stop the medication due to a side effect, compared to 7 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Antirheumatic Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Arthritis, Rheumatoid [*drug therapy]; Biological Products [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Drug Therapy, Combination [methods]; Humans; Methotrexate [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD010227.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010227.pub2","Musculoskeletal"

Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of nine biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) and small molecule tofacitinib, versus comparator (MTX, DMARD, placebo (PL), or a combination) in adults with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to methotrexate (MTX) or other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), i.e., MTX/DMARD incomplete responders (MTX/DMARD‐IR). Methods We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via  The Cochrane Library  Issue 6, June 2015), MEDLINE (via OVID 1946 to June 2015), and EMBASE (via OVID 1947 to June 2015). Data extraction, risk of bias and GRADE assessments were done in duplicate. We calculated both direct estimates using standard meta‐analysis and used Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons approach for NMA estimates to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI). We converted OR to risk ratios (RR) which are reported in the abstract for the ease of interpretation. Main results This update included 73 new RCTs for a total of 90 RCTs; 79 RCTs with 32,874 participants provided usable data. Few trials were at high risk of bias for blinding of assessors/participants (13% to 21%), selective reporting (4%) or major baseline imbalance (8%); a large number had unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation (68%) or allocation concealment (74%). Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in ACR50 versus comparator (RR 2.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36 to 3.10); absolute benefit 24% more patients (95% CI 19% to 29%), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 5 (4 to 6). NMA estimates for ACR50 in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 3.23 (95% credible interval (Crl) 2.75 to 3.79), non‐TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 2.99; 95% Crl 2.36 to 3.74), and anakinra + MTX/DMARD (RR 2.37 (95% Crl 1.00 to 4.70) were similar to the direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with a clinically and statistically important improvement in function measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (0 to 3 scale, higher = worse function) with a mean difference (MD) based on direct evidence of ‐0.25 (95% CI ‐0.28 to ‐0.22); absolute benefit of ‐8.3% (95% CI ‐9.3% to ‐7.3%), NNTB = 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). NMA estimates for TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute benefit, ‐10.3% (95% Crl ‐14% to ‐6.7%) and non‐TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute benefit, ‐7.3% (95% Crl ‐13.6% to ‐0.67%) were similar to respective direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with clinically and statistically significantly greater proportion of participants achieving remission in RA (defined by disease activity score DAS < 1.6 or DAS28 < 2.6) versus comparator (RR 2.81 (95% CI, 2.23 to 3.53); absolute benefit 18% more patients (95% CI 12% to 25%), NNTB = 6 (4 to 9)). NMA estimates for TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute improvement 17% (95% Crl 11% to 23%)) and non‐TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute improvement 19% (95% Crl 12% to 28%) were similar to respective direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), radiographic progression (scale 0 to 448) was statistically significantly reduced in those on biologics + MTX/DMARDs versus comparator, MD ‐2.61 (95% CI ‐4.08 to ‐1.14). The absolute reduction was small, ‐0.58% (95% CI ‐0.91% to ‐0.25%) and we are unsure of the clinical relevance of this reduction. NMA estimates of TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute reduction ‐0.67% (95% Crl ‐1.4% to ‐0.12%) and non‐TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute reduction, ‐0.68% (95% Crl ‐2.36% to 0.92%)) were similar to respective direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for imprecision), results for withdrawals due to adverse events were inconclusive, with wide confidence intervals encompassing the null effect and evidence of an important increase in withdrawals, RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.30). The NMA estimates of TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 1.24 (95% Crl 0.99 to 1.57)) and non‐TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 1.20 (95% Crl 0.87 to 1.67)) were similarly inconclusive and downgraded to low for both imprecision and indirectness. Based on direct evidence of high quality, biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with clinically significantly increased risk (statistically borderline significant) of serious adverse events on biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR [can be interpreted as RR due to low event rate] 1.12 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.27); absolute risk 1% (0% to 2%), As well, the NMA estimate for TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR 1.20 (95% Crl 1.01 to 1.43)) showed moderate quality evidence of an increase in the risk of serious adverse events. The other two NMA estimates were downgraded to low quality due to imprecision and indirectness and had wide confidence intervals resulting in uncertainty around the estimates: non‐TNF biologics + MTX/DMARD: 1.07 (95% Crl 0.89 to 1.29) and anakinra: RR 1.06 (95% Crl 0.65 to 1.75). Based on direct evidence of low quality (downgraded for serious imprecision), results were inconclusive for cancer (Peto OR 1.07 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.68) for all biologic+MTX/DMARD combinations. The NMA estimates of TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR 1.21 (95% Crl 0.63 to 2.38) and non‐TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR 0.99 (95% Crl 0.58 to 1.78)) were similarly inconclusive and downgraded to low quality for both imprecision and indirectness. Main results text shows the results for tofacitinib and differences between medications. Authors' conclusions Based primarily on RCTs of 6 months' to 12 months' duration, there is moderate quality evidence that the use of biologic+MTX/DMARD in people with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to MTX or other DMARDs results in clinically important improvement in function and higher ACR50 and remission rates, and increased risk of serious adverse events than the comparator (MTX/DMARD/PL; high quality evidence). Radiographic progression is slowed but its clinical relevance is uncertain. Results were inconclusive for whether biologics + MTX/DMARDs are associated with an increased risk of cancer or withdrawals due to adverse events. Plain language summary Biologics or tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis not improved by treatment with methotrexate or other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs What is rheumatoid arthritis and what are biologics? When people have rheumatoid arthritis (RA), their immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the joint lining. This makes their joints swollen, stiff and painful. If the inflammation goes on without treatment, joint damage and disability may result. Biologics and tofacitinib are medications that work by blocking different types of immune cells in the body that cause swelling and joint damage in people who have RA. This is an update of a review published in 2009. We have split the original review into four reviews based on patient population. We looked at trials done until June 2015 on the benefits and harms of biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab and tocilizumab) and tofacitinib on people with RA who had not improved with treatment of methotrexate or other DMARDs. The review shows that in people with rheumatoid arthritis: Biologics in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other DMARDs: ‐ probably improve signs and symptoms of RA (tender or swollen joints), function, the chances of RA remission (disappearance of symptoms) and slow down X‐ray disease progression. However, we are not sure of the importance of the amount of slowing of disease progression as seen on X‐rays. We downgraded our confidence in the results because of concerns about the inconsistency of some results. ‐ probably slightly increase the number of serious adverse events, though there are few events. We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Because of the lack of data, we are uncertain of the effect of biologics on the risk of cancer and withdrawals due to adverse events. Best estimate of what happens to people with RA taking biologics ACR50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other doctor/patient assessed aspects) Twenty‐four more people out of 100 experienced improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis with biologics + MTX/DMARD (24% absolute improvement). Thirty‐eight people out of 100 who were on biologic+ MTX experienced improvement compared to 14 people out of 100 who were on MTX/DMARD/placebo. Function improvement by Health Assessment Questionnaire (0 to 3 scale, lower score or more reduction = better function) People who took biologics + MTX/DMARDs rated their improvement in function to be 0.25 points more on a scale of 0 to 3 (‐8% absolute improvement). People who took biologics + MTX/DMARDs rated their function improved by 0.39 points on a scale of 0 to 3. People who took a MTX/DMARD/placebo rated their function improved by 0.14 points on a scale of 0 to 3. Remission Eighteen more people out of 100 experienced no symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis with biologics + MTX/DMARDs (18% absolute improvement). Twenty‐eight patients out of 100 who were on biologic+ MTX experienced no symptoms compared to 10 people out of 100 who were on MTX/DMARD/placebo. Progression of disease damage as measured on X‐rays (on a scale of 0 to 448) The damage to joints of people who took biologics + MTX/DMARDs was 2.6 points lower (‐0.58% absolute improvement). The damage to joints of people who took a MTX/DMARD/placebo was 3.7 points. Withdrawal from study due to adverse events Ten more people out of 1000 who took biologics + MTX/DMARD withdrew from the study due to adverse events (1% more withdrawals). Fifty‐five patients out of 1000 who took biologics + MTX/DMARD withdrew from the study compared to 45 people out of 1000 who were on MTX/DMARD/placebo. Serious Adverse Events Ten more people out of 1000 who took biologics + MTX/DMARD had serious adverse events (1% more serious adverse events). Seventy‐eight patients out of 1000 who took biologics + MTX/DMARD had serious adverse events compared to 68 people out of 1000 who were on MTX/DMARD/placebo; most common were infections. Cancer The same number of people (14 out of 1000) who took biologics + MTX/DMARDs compared to those on MTX/DMARD/placebo had cancer. However, we are cautious about this estimate as there were few events of cancer in the studies. Results for tofacitinib are provided in the results section.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adalimumab [therapeutic use]; Antibodies, Monoclonal [therapeutic use]; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized [therapeutic use]; Antirheumatic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis, Rheumatoid [*drug therapy]; Biological Products [*therapeutic use]; Certolizumab Pegol [therapeutic use]; Etanercept [therapeutic use]; Humans; Infliximab [therapeutic use]; Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein [therapeutic use]; Methotrexate [therapeutic use]; Piperidines [*therapeutic use]; Protein Kinase Inhibitors [*therapeutic use]; Pyrimidines [*therapeutic use]; Pyrroles [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rituximab [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD012183","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012183","Musculoskeletal"
"CD010794.PUB2","Moore, RA; Wiffen, PJ; Derry, S; Maguire, T; Roy, YM; Tyrrell, L","Non‐prescription (OTC) oral analgesics for acute pain ‐ an overview of Cochrane reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background Non‐prescription (over‐the‐counter, or OTC) analgesics (painkillers) are used frequently. They are available in various brands, package sizes, formulations, and dose. They can be used for a range of different types of pain, but this overview reports on how well they work for acute pain (pain of short duration, usually with rapid onset). Thirty‐nine Cochrane reviews of randomised trials have examined the analgesic efficacy of individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain. Objectives To examine published Cochrane reviews for information about the efficacy of pain medicines available without prescription using data from acute postoperative pain. Methods We identified OTC analgesics available in the UK, Australia, Canada, and the USA by examining online pharmacy websites. We also included some analgesics (diclofenac potassium, dexketoprofen, dipyrone) of importance in parts of the world, but not currently available in these jurisdictions. We identified systematic reviews by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) on  The Cochrane Library  through a simple search strategy. All reviews were overseen by a single review group, had a standard title, and had as their primary outcome numbers of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. From individual reviews we extracted the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for this outcome for each drug/dose combination, and also calculated the success rate to achieve at least 50% of maximum pain relief. We also examined the number of participants experiencing any adverse event, and whether the incidence was different from placebo. Main results We found information on 21 different OTC analgesic drugs, doses, and formulations, using information from 10 Cochrane reviews, supplemented by information from one non‐Cochrane review with additional information on ibuprofen formulations (high quality evidence). The lowest (best) NNT values were for combinations of ibuprofen plus paracetamol, with NNT values below 2. Analgesics with values close to 2 included fast acting formulations of ibuprofen 200 mg and 400 mg, ibuprofen 200 mg plus caffeine 100 mg, and diclofenac potassium 50 mg. Combinations of ibuprofen plus paracetamol had success rates of almost 70%, with dipyrone 500 mg, fast acting ibuprofen formulations 200 mg and 400 mg, ibuprofen 200 mg plus caffeine 100 mg, and diclofenac potassium 50 mg having success rates above 50%. Paracetamol and aspirin at various doses had NNT values of 3 or above, and success rates of 11% to 43%. We found no information on many of the commonly available low dose codeine combinations. The proportion of participants experiencing an adverse event were generally not different from placebo, except for aspirin 1000 mg and (barely) ibuprofen 200 mg plus caffeine 100 mg. For ibuprofen plus paracetamol, adverse event rates were lower than with placebo. Authors' conclusions There is a body of reliable evidence about the efficacy of some of the most commonly available drugs and doses widely available without prescription. The postoperative pain model is predominantly pain after third molar extraction, which is used as the industry model for everyday pain. The proportion of people with acute pain who get good pain relief with any of them ranges from around 70% at best to less than 20% at worst; low doses of some drugs in fast acting formulations were among the best. Adverse events were generally no different from placebo. Consumers can make an informed choice based on this knowledge, together with availability and price. Headache and migraine were not included in this overview. Plain language summary Oral painkillers available without prescription for acute pain Acute pain is often felt soon after injury, and is of short duration. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. Painkillers (analgesics) are tested in people with pain, often following the removal of wisdom teeth. Study participants have to have at least moderate pain levels and the pain is usually treated with painkillers taken by mouth. This overview is useful mainly for acute pain lasting only a few days or weeks, and not for chronic pain lasting for many months. For this overview we have not included information from reviews on migraine, tension headache, or period pain. In May 2015 we looked on pharmacy websites for the range of painkillers available in the UK that could be taken by mouth, and available without a doctor's prescription. We also looked at websites in Australia, Canada, and the USA. We then looked for Cochrane reviews reporting about how well these painkillers worked, and any side effects. We used high quality evidence from 10 Cochrane reviews supplemented with information from one non‐Cochrane analysis. The outcome we used for successful treatment was that of people with moderate or severe pain having at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief, over a period of about six hours. This is an outcome that people with acute and chronic pain, and headache, think is useful to them. Combinations of ibuprofen plus paracetamol worked in 7 out of 10 (70%) people, and fast acting ibuprofen formulations 200 mg and 400 mg, ibuprofen 200 mg plus caffeine 100 mg, and diclofenac potassium 50 mg worked in over 5 out of 10 (50%) people. Dipyrone 500 mg, which is available OTC in many parts of the world, also worked in about 5 out of 10 people. Paracetamol plus aspirin at various doses worked in 1 out of 10 (11%) to 4 out of 10 (43%) people. An important finding was that low doses of some medicines in fast acting formulations were among the best. We could find no information on many of the commonly available combinations containing low doses of codeine. Taking painkillers with food may reduce how well they work. There were fewer side effects for people taking ibuprofen plus paracetamol than those taking placebo (a pretend treatment).

This overview considers adverse events, with efficacy dealt with in a separate overview. Thirty‐nine Cochrane reviews of randomised trials have examined the adverse events associated with individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain. This overview brings together the results of those individual reviews. Objectives To provide an overview of adverse event rates associated with single‐dose oral analgesics, compared with placebo, for acute postoperative pain in adults. Methods We identified systematic reviews in  The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  on  The Cochrane Library  through a simple search strategy. All reviews were overseen by a single review group. We extracted information related to participants experiencing any adverse event, and reports of serious adverse events, and deaths from the individual reviews. Main results Information was available from 39 Cochrane reviews for 41 different analgesics or analgesic combinations (51 drug/dose/formulations) tested in single oral doses in participants with moderate or severe postoperative pain. This involved around 350 unique studies involving about 35,000 participants. Most studies involved younger participants with pain following removal of molar teeth. For most nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, and combinations not containing opioids, there were few examples where participants experienced significantly more or fewer adverse events than with placebo. For aspirin 1000 mg and diflunisal 1000 mg, opioids, or fixed‐dose combination drugs containing opioids, participants typically experienced significantly more adverse events than with placebo. Studies of combinations of ibuprofen and paracetamol reported significantly fewer adverse events. Serious adverse events were rare, occurring a rate of about 1 in 3200 participants. Most reviews did not report specific adverse events. Authors' conclusions Despite ongoing problems with the measurement, recording, and reporting of adverse events in clinical trials and in systematic reviews, the large amount of information available for single oral doses of analgesics provides evidence that adverse events rates are generally similar with active drug and placebo in these circumstances, except at higher doses of some drugs, and in combinations including opioids. Plain language summary Adverse events after single doses of oral analgesics for acute pain after operation in adults Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. Painkillers (analgesics) are tested in people with pain, often following the removal of wisdom teeth. In all these studies, the participants have to have at least moderate pain in order for there to be a sensitive measure of pain‐relieving properties. The pain is usually treated with painkillers taken by mouth. Results can be applied to other forms of acute pain. In May 2015, we performed searches to update an overview review originally published in 2011.  The Cochrane Library  now has 39 reviews of oral analgesic interventions for pain immediately after operations, with 41 different painkillers at various doses. How well the drugs work is reported in a different overview. In this overview, we used information from about 35,000 participants in about 350 studies to look specifically at the adverse events (unwanted effects) experienced with painkillers, and compared the results with those for placebo (dummy pill). Measuring adverse events is complicated because the particular method used to collect information influences how many adverse events are reported. Most people in the studies had wisdom teeth removed, were relatively young and fit, and were likely to take occasional painkillers. Adverse events may be different in people who are less well, older, or who take painkillers for several days or longer. The results we have showed that for most nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen, or diclofenac), paracetamol, and combinations of different painkillers that do not contain opioids (drugs like codeine), adverse events happened to the same proportion of people with painkillers and placebo. With aspirin 1000 mg, opioids, or fixed dose combinations containing opioids, people typically experienced significantly more adverse events than with placebo. A combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol resulted in significantly fewer adverse events than placebo. Serious adverse events were rare, occurring a rate of about 1 in 3200 people. The results are not unexpected for single dose studies, which are likely to be different from the situation when analgesics are taken over the medium or longer term.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Review Literature as Topic; Acute Pain [*drug therapy, etiology]; Administration, Oral; Adult; Analgesics [administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Analgesics, Opioid [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Drug Therapy, Combination [adverse effects]; Humans; Pain, Postoperative [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD011407.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011407.pub2","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

That overview considered both efficacy and adverse events, but adverse events are now dealt with in a separate overview. Thirty‐nine Cochrane reviews of randomised trials have examined the analgesic efficacy of individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain. This overview brings together the results of those individual reviews and assesses the reliability of available data. Objectives To summarise the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions for acute pain in adults with at least moderate pain following surgery who have been given a single dose of oral analgesic. Methods We identified systematic reviews in  the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  in  The Cochrane Library  through a simple search strategy. All reviews were overseen by a single review group, had a standard title, and had as their primary outcome the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. For individual reviews, we extracted the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for this outcome for each drug/dose combination, and also the percentage of participants achieving at least 50% maximum pain relief, the mean of mean or median time to remedication, and the percentage of participants remedicating by six, eight, 12, or 24 hours. Where there was adequate information for pairs of drug and dose (at least 200 participants, in at least two studies), we defined the addition of four comparisons of typical size (400 participants in total) with zero effect as making the result potentially subject to publication bias and therefore unreliable. Main results The overview included 39 separate Cochrane Reviews with 41 analyses of single dose oral analgesics tested in acute postoperative pain models, with results from about 50,000 participants in approximately 460 individual studies. The individual reviews included only high‐quality trials of standardised design, methods, and efficacy outcome reporting. No statistical comparison was undertaken. Reliable results (high quality information) were obtained for 53 pairs of drug and dose in painful postsurgical conditions; these included various fixed dose combinations, and fast acting formulations of some analgesics. NNTs varied from about 1.5 to 20 for at least 50% maximum pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. The proportion of participants achieving this level of benefit varied from about 30% to over 70%, and the time to remedication varied from two hours (placebo) to over 20 hours. Good (low) NNTs were obtained with ibuprofen 200 mg plus paracetamol (acetaminophen) 500 mg (NNT compared with placebo 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 1.8), ibuprofen fast acting 200 mg (2.1; 1.9 to 2.3); ibuprofen 200 mg plus caffeine 100 mg (2.1; 1.9 to 3.1), diclofenac potassium 50 mg (2.1; 1.9 to 2.5), and etoricoxib 120 mg (1.8; 1.7 to 2.0). For comparison, ibuprofen acid 400 mg had an NNT of 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6). Not all participants had good pain relief and, for many pairs of drug and dose, 50% or more did not achieve at least 50% maximum pain relief over four to six hours. Long duration of action (eight hours or greater) was found for etoricoxib 120 mg, diflunisal 500 mg, paracetamol 650 mg plus oxycodone 10 mg, naproxen 500/550 mg, celecoxib 400 mg, and ibuprofen 400 mg plus paracetamol 1000 mg. There was no evidence of analgesic effect for aceclofenac 150 mg, aspirin 500 mg, and oxycodone 5 mg (low quality evidence). No trial data were available in reviews of acemetacin, meloxicam, nabumetone, nefopam, sulindac, tenoxicam, and tiaprofenic acid. Inadequate amounts of data were available for nine drugs and doses, and data potentially susceptible to publication bias for 13 drugs and doses (very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is a wealth of reliable evidence on the analgesic efficacy of single dose oral analgesics. Fast acting formulations and fixed dose combinations of analgesics can produce good and often long‐lasting analgesia at relatively low doses. There is also important information on drugs for which there are no data, inadequate data, or where results are unreliable due to susceptibility to publication bias. This should inform choices by professionals and consumers. Plain language summary Comparing single doses of oral analgesics for acute pain in adults after operation Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. Painkillers (analgesics) are tested in people with pain, often following the removal of wisdom teeth. In all these studies the participants have to have at least moderate pain in order for there to be a sensitive measure of pain‐relieving properties.

In May 2015 we performed searches to update an overview review originally published in 2011.  The Cochrane Library  now has 39 reviews of oral analgesic medicines, with 41 different medicines at various doses. These involved about 50,000 participants in about 450 studies. This overview sought to bring all the high quality information together about how well the medicines work; side effects are reported in a different overview. For some medicines there were no published trials. For other medicines there was inadequate information. For some medicines, there was adequate information, but the results could be overturned by just a few unpublished studies in which there was no effect. None of these could be regarded as reliable. There remained 53 pairs of medicine and dose with reliable evidence. The range of results with single dose analgesics in participants with moderate or severe acute pain was from 7 out of 10 (70%) achieving good pain relief with the best medicine to about 3 out of 10 (30%) with the worst medicine. No medicine produced high levels of pain relief in all participants. The period over which pain was relieved also varied, from about two hours to about 20 hours. Good results were found for medicines combined in a fixed dose in a single tablet, or medicines made for rapid absorption from the stomach. Commonly used analgesic medicines at the recommended or licensed doses produce good pain relief in many, but not all, people with acute pain. The reasons for this are varied, but people in pain should not be surprised if medicines they are given do not work for them. Alternative analgesic medicines or methods should be found that do work.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acute Pain [*drug therapy]; Administration, Oral; Adult; Analgesics [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Humans; Pain, Postoperative [*drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD008659.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008659.pub3","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding dressing use. Objectives To summarize data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trial evidence on the effectiveness of dressings for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods We searched the following databases for relevant systematic reviews and associated analyses: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;  The Cochrane Library  2015, Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE;  The Cochrane Library  2015, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, 14 April 2015); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 14 April 2015). We also handsearched the Cochrane Wounds Group list of reviews. Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Complete wound healing was the primary outcome assessed; secondary outcomes included health‐related quality of life, adverse events, resource use and dressing performance. Main results We found 13 eligible systematic reviews relevant to this overview that contained a total of 17 relevant RCTs. One review reported the results of a network meta‐analysis and so presented information on indirect, as well as direct, treatment effects. Collectively the reviews reported findings for 11 different comparisons supported by direct data and 26 comparisons supported by indirect data only. Only four comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in wound healing between dressing types, but the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality (in one case data could not be located and checked). There was also no robust evidence of a difference between dressing types for any secondary outcomes assessed. Authors' conclusions There is currently no robust evidence for differences between wound dressings for any outcome in foot ulcers in people with diabetes (treated in any setting). Practitioners may want to consider the unit cost of dressings, their management properties and patient preference when choosing dressings. Plain language summary Dressings to treat foot ulcers in people with diabetes Background Diabetes mellitus (generally known as 'diabetes'), when untreated, causes a rise in the sugar (glucose) levels in the blood. It is a serious health issue that affects millions of people around the world (e.g., almost two million people in the UK and 24 million people in the USA). Foot ulcers are a common problem for people with diabetes; at least 15% of people with diabetes have foot ulcers at some time during their lives. Wound dressings are used extensively in the care of these ulcers. There are many different types of dressings available, from basic wound contact dressings to more advanced gels, films, and specialist dressings that may be saturated with ingredients that exhibit particular properties (e.g. antimicrobial activity). Given this wide choice, a clear and up‐to‐date overview of the available research evidence is needed to help clinicians/practitioners to decide which type of dressing to use. Review question What is the evidence that the type of wound dressing used for foot ulcers in people with diabetes affects healing? What we found This overview drew together and summarised evidence from 13 systematic reviews that contained 17 relevant randomised controlled trials (the best type of study for this type of question) published up to 2013. Collectively, these trials compared 10 different types of wound dressings against each other, making a total of 37 separate comparisons. The different ways in which dressing types were compared made it difficult to combine and analyse the results. Only four of the comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in ulcer healing between dressings, but these results were classed as low quality evidence. There was no clear evidence that any of the 'advanced' wound dressings types were any better than basic wound contact dressings for healing foot ulcers. The overview findings were restricted by the small amount of information available (a limited number of trials involving small numbers of participants). Until there is a clear answer about which type of dressing performs best for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes, other factors, such as clinical management of the wound, cost, and patient preference and comfort, should influence the choice of dressing.

"CD010337.PUB2","Welsh, EJ; Evans, DJ; Fowler, SJ; Spencer, S","Interventions for bronchiectasis: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by abnormal dilatation of the bronchi, and presents typically with a chronic productive cough (or chronic wet cough in children) and recurrent infective exacerbations. It significantly impacts daily activities and quality of life, and can lead to recurrent hospitalisations, severe lung function impairment, respiratory failure and even death. Objectives To provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of interventions for adults and children with bronchiectasis from Cochrane reviews. To identify gaps in the evidence base that will inform recommendations for new research and reviews, and to summarise information on reported outcomes and make recommendations for the reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews. Methods We included Cochrane reviews of non‐cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 11 February 2015. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but not currently included in, published reviews to make recommendations for new Cochrane reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the AMSTAR criteria. We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials and guideline data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, lung function and quality of life. Main results We included 21 reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, only nine reviews that reported results for people with bronchiectasis alone. Of the reviews with no usable data, two reviews included studies with mixed clinical populations where data were not reported separately for people with bronchiectasis and 10 reviews did not contain any trials. Of the 40 studies included across the nine reviews, three (number of participants nine to 34) included children. The studies ranged from single session to year‐long studies. Each review included from one to 11 trials and 28 (70%) trials in the overview included 40 or fewer participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 1040. The age range of adult participants was from 36 to 73 years and children ranged from six to 16 years. The proportion of male participants ranged from 21% to 72%. Where reported, mean baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) ranged from 1.17 L to 1.66 L and from 47% to 88% predicted. Most of the reviews had search dates older than two years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane reviews, but it was not possible to draw definitive conclusions. There was inconclusive evidence on the use of long‐term antibiotics and nebulised hypertonic saline for reducing exacerbation frequency and evidence that human deoxyribonuclease (RhDNase) increases exacerbation frequency. Improvements in lung function were reported for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) though this was small and not clinically relevant. Evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents and mucolytics was inconclusive. There was limited evidence of improvements in quality of life with airway clearance techniques and physical therapy but evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents was inconclusive. Secondary outcomes were not clearly reported in all trials in the included reviews. Improvements in dyspnoea, wheeze and cough‐free days were reported for small trials of ICS and LABA (long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonsts)/ICS and cough reduction was also reported for a small bromhexine trial. Reduction in sputum production was reported for long‐term antibiotics and airway clearance techniques but evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents was inconclusive. Adverse events were included as outcomes in seven reviews. The review of long‐term (four weeks to one year) prophylactic courses of antibiotics reported significantly more cases of wheeze (Peto odd ratio (OR) 8.56, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.63 to 44.93), dyspnoea (12 versus three, P value = 0.01) and chest pain (seven versus zero, P value = 0.01) from the same trial (74 participants) but no differences in occurrence of diarrhoea, rash or number of withdrawals. In the review of mucolytics versus placebo, relevant outcomes were not reported for erdosteine comparisons and no significant adverse effects were reported for bromhexine, though adverse events were associated with RhDNase (OR 28.19, 95% CI 3.77 to 210.85, 1 study). Of the remaining five reviews, adverse events were not reported in the single trials included in the ICS review or the physical therapy review and the impact of adverse events in the single trial included in the inhaled LABA/ICS combination versus ICS review were unclear. The reviews of short‐term courses of antibiotics and inhaled hyperosmolar agents reported no significant differences in occurrence of adverse events. Fewer admissions to hospital were reported for long‐term antibiotics, but this outcome was not reported in all reviews. No reviews reported differences in mortality, but again this outcome was not included in all reviews. We did not explicitly include antibiotic resistance as an outcome in the review, but this was unclear in the Cochrane reviews and evidence from other trials should be considered. We rated all reviews as high quality (AMSTAR), though opportunities for improved reporting (e.g. summary of findings and GRADE evaluation of the evidence) were identified for inclusion in future updates of the reviews. However, the majority of trials were not high quality and confidence in the effects of treatments, therefore, requires additional evidence from larger and more methodologically robust trials. We evaluated the overall coverage of important topics in bronchiectasis by mapping the quality of the current evidence base against published guidelines and identifying high priority areas for new research on; use of short‐course and long‐term antibiotics, ICS and oral corticosteroids, inhaled hyperosmolars, mucolytics, and use of airway clearance techniques. Authors' conclusions This overview clearly points to significant opportunities for further research aimed at improving outcomes for people with bronchiectasis. We have highlighted important endpoints for studies (particularly exacerbations, quality of life and lung function), and areas of clinical practice that are in most urgent need of evidence‐based support (including long‐term antibiotics, ICSs and mucolytics). As the evidence is confined to small trials of short duration, it is not currently possible to assess the balance between the benefits and potential harms of treatments for bronchiectasis. Plain language summary Interventions for bronchiectasis: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews What is bronchiectasis? Bronchiectasis is a long‐term respiratory disease that is commonly associated with a troublesome cough productive of mucous (or chronic wet cough in children) and recurrent flare‐ups (exacerbations) due to lung infections. It significantly impacts upon normal daily activities and quality of life, and can lead to recurrent hospitalisations, loss of lung function and even death. We looked at the available Cochrane reviews on bronchiectasis and found overall that there are relatively few trials and Cochrane reviews available so it is difficult to draw helpful conclusions about how to treat bronchiectasis. Overviews are designed to present the contents from a selection of reviews in a concise and helpful manner. To do this, we made an evidence map of the available information from guidelines, clinical trials and Cochrane reviews, and highlighted the need for new research. We have listed the most important outcomes for measuring benefit and harm in bronchiectasis (particularly exacerbations, quality of life and lung function), and areas of clinical practice that are in most urgent need of evidence‐based support (including long term antibiotics, inhaled corticosteroids and mucolytics) in future studies. The key findings for difference medicines and treatments were: ‐ Long‐term antibiotics may reduce sputum (a mixture of saliva and mucous that is coughed up from the airways) production, frequency of exacerbations and hospitalisation, but may also be associated with more frequent side effects (wheeze, dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) and chest pain). ‐ Inhaled corticosteroid treatment may improve lung function but the effect is small. ‐ Bromhexine may reduce cough, but evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents and mucolytics is generally unclear. ‐ Airway clearance techniques may reduce sputum production and improve quality of life. ‐ RhDNase (a medicine used to treat bronchiectasis) is associated with more frequent exacerbations. ‐ long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists/ICS combination therapy may reduce dyspnoea, wheeze and cough. About 70% of trials in the reviews included in the overview were small (40 participants or fewer), which limits interpretation. Side effects were reported in seven reviews: ‐ Long‐term courses of antibiotics were associated with more cases of wheeze, breathlessness and chest pain, but we could not assess the risks of developing antibiotic resistance. ‐ In the review comparing mucolytics (medicines that make the mucous less thick and sticky and easier to cough up) with placebo (a pretend medicine), side effects were not reported for erdosteine comparisons. No significant side effects were reported for bromhexine, though side effects were associated with RhDNase. ‐ Side effects were not reported in the single trials included in the inhaled corticosteroid review or the physical therapy review and the impact of adverse events in the single trial included in the inhaled corticosteroid/long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists combination versus inhaled corticosteroids review were unclear. ‐ The reviews of short‐term courses of antibiotics and inhaled hyperosmolar agents reported no significant differences in occurrence of side effects. Fewer admissions to hospital were reported for long‐term antibiotics. ‐ No reviews reported significant differences in deaths between treatment and control groups, but only a small number of reviews recorded deaths. The included evidence came from: ‐ 21 Cochrane reviews, but there was only useable data in nine reviews. ‐ Forty trials were included in the nine reviews and 28 (70%) of the trials included 40 or fewer participants. Only three trials (nine to 34 participants) included children. ‐ Each review included from one to 11 trials. ‐ The studies ranged from single session to year‐long studies. ‐ The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 1040. ‐ The age range of adult participants was from 36 to 73 years and children ranged from six to 16 years. ‐ The included reviews were judged to be of high quality. ‐ However, the majority of trials in the bronchiectasis reviews were small and at risk of bias, so confidence in the effects of treatments therefore requires additional evidence from larger and more methodologically robust trials","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Review Literature as Topic; Adrenal Cortex Hormones [therapeutic use]; Adult; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Bronchiectasis [*therapy]; Child; Deoxyribonucleases [adverse effects]; Expectorants [therapeutic use]; Humans; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD010337.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010337.pub2","Airways"
"CD011254.PUB2","Hindocha, A; Beere, L; Dias, S; Watson, A; Ahmad, G","Adhesion prevention agents for gynaecological surgery: an overview of Cochrane reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background Intraperitoneal adhesions are associated with considerable co‐morbidity and have large financial and public health repercussions. They have secondary effects that include chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, subfertility and bowel obstruction. In women with adhesions, subsequent surgery is more difficult, often takes longer, and is associated with a higher complication rate ( Broek 2013 ). The significant burden of adhesions has led to the development of several anti‐adhesion agents, although there is disagreement as to their relative effectiveness. Objectives To summarise evidence derived from Cochrane systematic reviews on the clinical safety and effectiveness of solid agents, gel agents, liquid agents and pharmacological agents, used as adjuvants to prevent formation of adhesions after gynaecological pelvic surgery. Methods The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched using the keyword 'adhesion' up to August 2014. The Cochrane information management system was also searched for any titles or protocols of reviews in progress. Two review authors independently extracted information from the reviews, with disagreements being resolved by a third review author. The quality of the included reviews was described in a narrative manner, and the AMSTAR tool was used to formally assess each review included in this overview. The quality of evidence provided in the original reviews was described using GRADE methods. Main results We included two reviews, one with 18 studies comparing solid agents (oxidised regenerated cellulose expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose, and fibrin sheets) with control or with each other. The other review included 29 studies which compared liquid agents (4% icodextrin, 32% dextran, crystalloids), gel agents (carboxymethylcellulose and polyethylene oxide, polyethylene glycol gels, hyaluronic acid based gel, 0.5% ferric hyaluronate gel, sodium hyaluronate spray) and pharmacological agents (gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonist, reteplase plasminogen activator, N,O‐carboxymethyl chitosan, steroid agents, intraperitoneal noxytioline, intraperitoneal heparin, systemic promethazine) with control or each other. Both reviews met all of the criteria of the AMSTAR assessment. The reviews included as outcomes both the primary outcomes of this overview (pelvic pain, pregnancy, live birth rate and quality of life (QoL)) and our secondary outcomes (adverse effects, presence or absence of adhesions at second–look laparoscopy (SLL) and adhesion score). However, neither of the reviews identified any primary studies of solid, gel or pharmacological agents that reported any of our primary outcomes. The only studies in either review that reported any of our primary outcomes were studies comparing liquid agents versus control (saline or Hartmann's solution), which reported pelvic pain (two studies), live birth (two studies) and pregnancy (three studies). An external source of funding was stated for 25 of the 47 studies across both reviews; in 24 of these studies the funding was commercial. Solid agents (18 studies) None of our primary outcomes were reported. Adverse events were reported as an outcome by only 9 of the 18 studies. These reported no adverse events. Liquid agents (nine studies) There was no evidence of a difference between liquid agents and control (saline or Hartmann's solution) with respect to pelvic pain (odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.14, 1 study, n = 286, moderate quality evidence), pregnancy rate (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.14, 3 studies, n = 310, moderate quality evidence) or live birth rate (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.58, 2 studies, n = 208, moderate quality evidence). No studies of liquid agents reported QoL. Adverse events were not reported as an outcome by any of the nine studies. Gel agents (seven studies) None of our primary outcomes were reported. Adverse events were not reported as an outcome by any of the seven studies. Pharmacological agents (seven studies) None of our primary outcomes were reported. Adverse events were reported as an outcome by only one of the seven primary studies. This study reported no evidence of difference in ectopic pregnancy rates between intraperitoneal noxytioline and no treatment (OR 4.91, 95% CI 0.45 to 53.27, 1 study, n = 33, low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to allow us to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of anti‐adhesion agents in gynaecological surgery, due to the lack of data on pelvic pain, fertility outcomes, quality of life or safety. A substantial proportion of research in this field has been funded by private companies that manufacture these agents, and further high powered, independent trials will be needed before definitive conclusions can be made. Plain language summary Agents that prevent the development of abdominal adhesions following surgery: an overview of Cochrane reviews Background Abdominal adhesions are web like structures that commonly form following abdominal or pelvic surgery. They are a result of damage to the lining of the abdomen and can cause multiple conditions such as chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Many types of solid, liquid, gel and pharmacological agents have been developed which, when applied during surgery, supposedly reduce the chance that adhesions will develop. However, there has been considerable disagreement as to which agent is more effective. We aimed to summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews regarding anti‐adhesion agents in gynaecological surgery. Search results Our search up to 31 August 2014 identified two Cochrane reviews. One focused on solid agents, while the other focused on liquid and gel anti‐adhesion agents as well as drugs that may prevent adhesions from forming. All reviews were high quality, though the quality of specific comparisons in each review ranged from low to high as a result of the limitations of the original studies. The characteristics of the women who underwent the trials were recorded poorly among the trials. Overview of the effectiveness of different anti‐adhesion agents There was no evidence of a difference between liquid agents compared to no treatment or placebo on pelvic pain, pregnancy rates or live birth rates following surgery (moderate quality of evidence). There were no studies that investigated other anti‐adhesion agents in preventing pelvic pain or infertility directly. Adverse events were reported as an outcome by only 10 of the 47 primary studies. These reported no adverse events. An external source of funding was stated for 25 of the 47 studies across both reviews; in 24 of these studies the funding was commercial. The lack of studies investigating the effect of these agents on pelvic pain and fertility means that it is impossible to judge whether the reduction in adhesions produced by these agents translates to any benefit to the patient. Furthermore, the multiple different ways in which adhesions were measured made it difficult to combine studies. A substantial proportion of research in this field has been funded by private companies that manufacture these agents, and further high powered, independent trials will be needed before definitive conclusions can be made.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Female; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures [*adverse effects]; Humans; Pelvic Pain [etiology]; Review Literature as Topic; Tissue Adhesions [*prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD011254.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011254.pub2","Gynaecology and Fertility"
"CD011273.PUB2","Anderson, L; Taylor, RS","Cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2014","Abstract - Background Overviews are a new approach to summarising evidence and synthesising results from related systematic reviews. Objectives To conduct an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews to provide a contemporary review of the evidence for delivery of cardiac rehabilitation, to identify opportunities for merging or splitting existing Cochrane reviews, and to identify current evidence gaps to inform new cardiac rehabilitation systematic review titles. Methods We searched The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014, Issue 10) to identify systematic reviews that addressed the objectives of this overview. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R‐AMSTAR) measurement tool and the quality of the evidence for reported outcomes using the GRADE framework. The focus of the data presentation was descriptive with detailed tabular presentations of review level and trial level characteristics and results. Main results We found six Cochrane systematic reviews and judged them to be of high methodological quality. They included 148 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in 98,093 participants. Compared with usual care alone, the addition of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation in low‐risk people after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention or with heart failure appeared to have no impact on mortality, but did reduce hospital admissions and improved health‐related quality of life. Psychological‐ and education‐based interventions alone appeared to have little or no impact on mortality or morbidity but may have improved health‐related quality of life. Home‐ and centre‐based programmes were equally effective in improving quality of life outcomes at similar healthcare costs. Selected interventions can increase the uptake of cardiac rehabilitation programmes whilst there is currently only weak evidence to support interventions that improve adherence to cardiac rehabilitation programmes. The quality of the primary RCTs in the included systematic reviews was variable, and limitations in the methodological quality of the RCTs led to downgrading of the quality of the evidence, which varied widely by review and by outcome. Authors' conclusions Exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation is an effective and safe therapy to be used in the management of clinically stable people following myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention or who have heart failure. Future RCTs of cardiac rehabilitation need to improve their reporting methods and reflect the real world practice better including the recruitment of higher risk people and consideration of contemporary models of cardiac rehabilitation delivery, and identify effective interventions for enhancing adherence to rehabilitation. Plain language summary Participation in rehabilitation programmes that include regular exercise, can improve the quality of life for people with heart disease Background Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) seeks to improve the function, health‐related quality of life and well‐being of people with heart disease through a combination of activities, in particular exercise training alongside educational and psychological support. Since the mid‐2000s, the number of published Cochrane reviews has grown to six systematic reviews/meta‐analyses of CR. These reviews assessed the impact of CR on different types of heart disease (e.g. following a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure) or different ways of providing CR (e.g. in a hospital‐ or home‐based setting, exercise only programmes or exercise in combination with an educational or psychological intervention or both). The aim of the overview was to review the current CR Cochrane reviews to provide a 'friendly front end' to this 'portfolio' of reviews. Study characteristics We searched for Cochrane reviews that analysed the data from randomised controlled trials (RCT; experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups), which looked at the effectiveness of CR in adults with heart disease and compared patient outcomes with a no‐exercise control group. This overview summarised the findings from these reviews. Key results We found six high‐quality Cochrane reviews that included 148 RCTs in 98,093 people who primarily had experienced a heart attack, had undergone cardiac surgery or had chronic heart failure. The findings of this overview showed important benefits of CR participation that included a reduction in the risk of hospital admissions, as well as improvements in health‐related quality of life compared with not undertaking rehabilitation. Quality of the evidence The quality of the RCTs in the included systematic reviews was variable, and limitations in their methodological quality led to downgrading of the quality of the evidence, which varied widely by review and outcome. We make the following recommendations for the future conduct and reporting of systematic reviews of CR. • The scope of CR reviews needs to reflect current guidelines that recommend that CR should be based on an individually prescribed programme of exercise training with appropriate co‐interventions. • Future CR reviews need to explore the complexity of CR using appropriate approaches to explore the association between intervention characteristics and outcomes across trials. • Future Cochrane CR reviews need to standardise their methods and reporting.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Coronary Disease [*rehabilitation]; Exercise Therapy [*methods]; Heart Failure [*rehabilitation]; Humans; Myocardial Infarction [*rehabilitation]; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [*rehabilitation]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD011273.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011273.pub2","Heart"
"CD010820.PUB2","Pollock, A; Farmer, SE; Brady, MC; Langhorne, P; Mead, GE; Mehrholz, J; van Wijck, F","Interventions for improving upper limb function after stroke","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2014","Abstract - Background Improving upper limb function is a core element of stroke rehabilitation needed to maximise patient outcomes and reduce disability. Evidence about effects of individual treatment techniques and modalities is synthesised within many reviews. For selection of effective rehabilitation treatment, the relative effectiveness of interventions must be known. However, a comprehensive overview of systematic reviews in this area is currently lacking. Objectives To carry out a Cochrane overview by synthesising systematic reviews of interventions provided to improve upper limb function after stroke. Methods Search methods: We comprehensively searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; the Database of Reviews of Effects; and PROSPERO (an international prospective register of systematic reviews) (June 2013). We also contacted review authors in an effort to identify further relevant reviews. Selection criteria: We included Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with stroke comparing upper limb interventions with no treatment, usual care or alternative treatments. Our primary outcome of interest was upper limb function; secondary outcomes included motor impairment and performance of activities of daily living. When we identified overlapping reviews, we systematically identified the most up‐to‐date and comprehensive review and excluded reviews that overlapped with this. Data collection and analysis: Two overview authors independently applied the selection criteria, excluding reviews that were superseded by more up‐to‐date reviews including the same (or similar) studies. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of reviews (using a modified version of the AMSTAR tool) and extracted data. Quality of evidence within each comparison in each review was determined using objective criteria (based on numbers of participants, risk of bias, heterogeneity and review quality) to apply GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) levels of evidence. We resolved disagreements through discussion. We systematically tabulated the effects of interventions and used quality of evidence to determine implications for clinical practice and to make recommendations for future research. Main results Our searches identified 1840 records, from which we included 40 completed reviews (19 Cochrane; 21 non‐Cochrane), covering 18 individual interventions and dose and setting of interventions. The 40 reviews contain 503 studies (18,078 participants). We extracted pooled data from 31 reviews related to 127 comparisons. We judged the quality of evidence to be high for 1/127 comparisons (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) demonstrating no benefit for outcomes of activities of daily living (ADLs)); moderate for 49/127 comparisons (covering seven individual interventions) and low or very low for 77/127 comparisons. Moderate‐quality evidence showed a beneficial effect of constraint‐induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice, suggesting that these may be effective interventions; moderate‐quality evidence also indicated that unilateral arm training may be more effective than bilateral arm training. Information was insufficient to reveal the relative effectiveness of different interventions. Moderate‐quality evidence from subgroup analyses comparing greater and lesser doses of mental practice, repetitive task training and virtual reality demonstrates a beneficial effect for the group given the greater dose, although not for the group given the smaller dose; however tests for subgroup differences do not suggest a statistically significant difference between these groups. Future research related to dose is essential. Specific recommendations for future research are derived from current evidence. These recommendations include but are not limited to adequately powered, high‐quality RCTs to confirm the benefit of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice; high‐quality RCTs to explore the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), tDCS, hands‐on therapy, music therapy, pharmacological interventions and interventions for sensory impairment; and up‐to‐date reviews related to biofeedback, Bobath therapy, electrical stimulation, reach‐to‐grasp exercise, repetitive task training, strength training and stretching and positioning. Authors' conclusions Large numbers of overlapping reviews related to interventions to improve upper limb function following stroke have been identified, and this overview serves to signpost clinicians and policy makers toward relevant systematic reviews to support clinical decisions, providing one accessible, comprehensive document, which should support clinicians and policy makers in clinical decision making for stroke rehabilitation. Currently, no high‐quality evidence can be found for any interventions that are currently used as part of routine practice, and evidence is insufficient to enable comparison of the relative effectiveness of interventions. Effective collaboration is urgently needed to support large, robust RCTs of interventions currently used routinely within clinical practice. Evidence related to dose of interventions is particularly needed, as this information has widespread clinical and research implications. Plain language summary Interventions to improve arm and hand function in people after stroke Research question Which interventions help to promote arm and hand recovery after a person has had a stroke? Background Problems with arm function (upper limb impairments) are very common after a stroke. These upper limb impairments commonly include difficulty moving and co‐ordinating the arms, hands and fingers, often resulting in difficulty carrying out daily activities such as eating, dressing and washing. More than half of people with upper limb impairment after stroke will still have problems many months to years after their stroke. Improving arm function is a core element of rehabilitation. Many possible interventions have been developed; these may involve different exercises or training, specialist equipment or techniques, or they could take the form of a drug (pill or injection) given to help arm movement. Upper limb rehabilitation after stroke often involves several different interventions and generally requires the co‐operation of the patient, carers and rehabilitation team. To help people easily access information about effective interventions, and to help them compare the effects of different interventions, we have carried out a Cochrane overview. We aimed to bring together all systematic reviews of interventions provided to improve upper limb (arm) function after stroke. Review characteristics We searched for Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews of the effectiveness of interventions to improve arm function after stroke. We included 40 systematic reviews (19 Cochrane reviews and 21 non‐Cochrane reviews). The evidence is current to June 2013. The reviews covered 18 different types of interventions, as well as the dose of the intervention and the setting in which the intervention was delivered. These reviews varied in relation to the populations included (initial upper limb impairment and stroke severity) and in relation to the comparison groups included (which were given control interventions, no treatment and conventional therapy). We extracted details of 127 comparisons that had been explored within the reviews. These showed the extent to which different interventions had had an effect on upper limb function, upper limb impairment and ability to perform activities of daily living. Key results Currently no high‐quality evidence is available for any interventions currently used as part of routine practice. Evidence is insufficient to show which are the most effective interventions for improving upper limb function. Moderate‐quality evidence suggests that the following interventions may be effective: constraint‐induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice. Moderate‐quality evidence also indicates that unilateral arm training (exercise for the affected arm) may be more effective than bilateral arm training (doing the same exercise with both arms at the same time). Some evidence shows that a greater dose of an intervention is better than a lesser dose. Additional research to identify the optimal dose of arm rehabilitation is essential. Bringing together all available systematic review evidence has helped us make specific recommendations for future research. These recommendations include (but are not limited to) large randomised controlled trials of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy and virtual reality. We recommend high‐quality up‐to‐date reviews and further primary research for several specific interventions. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of evidence to be high in relation to one intervention: a type of brain stimulation called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is not currently used within routine practice. This high‐quality evidence shows that tDCS does not improve people's ability to perform activities of daily living. We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate for 48 comparisons (covering seven individual interventions) and low or very low for 76 comparisons. Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence to moderate, low or very low include small numbers of studies and participants, poor methodological quality or reporting of studies included within reviews, substantial heterogeneity (variation) between study results and poor review quality or reporting of methods. We conclude that high‐quality evidence related to the effectiveness of interventions to improve upper limb function is urgently needed, in particular for those interventions for which moderate‐quality evidence currently suggests a beneficial effect.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Imagination; *Recovery of Function; *Robotics; *Stroke Rehabilitation; *Upper Extremity; Activities of Daily Living; Exercise Movement Techniques [*methods]; Exercise Therapy [*methods]; Humans; Review Literature as Topic; Therapy, Computer‐Assisted [methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD010820.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010820.pub2","Stroke"
"CD009108.PUB2","Derry, CJ; Derry, S; Moore, RA","Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults ‐ overview of Cochrane reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2014","Abstract - Background Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide‐reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. It is available for administration by four different routes: oral, subcutaneous, intranasal, and rectal. Objectives To summarise evidence from four Cochrane intervention reviews on the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults by four routes of administration (oral, subcutaneous, intranasal, and rectal) compared with both placebo and active comparators. Methods The included reviews were written by the authors of this overview; no additional searching was carried out. All included reviews were conducted according to a standard protocol and reported a standard set of outcomes. From each individual review we extracted results for pain relief at different levels, and adverse events. No additional statistical comparison was undertaken as part of the overview. We focused on the most important findings for doses and routes licensed in North America or Europe (oral 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg; subcutaneous 4 mg, 6 mg; intranasal 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg; rectal 25 mg). Main results Included reviews provided data for 18 different dose and route of administration combinations in 52,236 participants. Data for the primary outcomes sought were generally well reported, and involved adequate numbers of participants to give confidence in the results, except for the rectal route of administration, where numbers were low. Subcutaneous administration was the most effective, with pain reduced from moderate or severe to none by two hours in almost 6 in 10 people (59%) taking 6 mg sumatriptan, compared with approximately 1 in 7 (15%) taking placebo; the number needed to treat (NNT) was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 2.4) with 2522 participants in the analysis. The most commonly used doses of oral, rectal, and intranasal sumatriptan also provided clinically useful pain relief, with the oral 50 mg dose providing complete relief of pain in almost 3 in 10 people (28%) compared with about 1 in 10 (11%) after placebo (NNT 6.1 (5.5 to 6.9) in 6447 participants). Subcutaneous administration provided more rapid pain relief than the other routes. Taking medication early, when pain was mild, was more effective than waiting until the pain was moderate or severe. The most effective dose of sumatriptan for each route of administration for the outcome of headache relief (pain reduced from moderate or severe to none or mild) at two hours was oral 100 mg (NNT 3.5 (3.2 to 3.7) in 7811 participants), subcutaneous 6 mg (NNT 2.1 (2.0 to 2.2) in 2738 participants), intranasal 20 mg (NNT 3.5 (3.1 to 4.1) in 2020 participants), and rectal 25 mg (NNT 2.4 (1.9 to 3.4) in 240 participants). Adverse events were generally of mild or moderate severity, of short duration, and more common with subcutaneously administered sumatriptan and higher doses of oral and intranasal sumatriptan than with other dose and route combinations. Authors' conclusions Sumatriptan is an effective abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, but is associated with increased adverse events relative to placebo. The route of administration influences efficacy, particularly within the first hour after administration. Subcutaneous sumatriptan shows the greatest efficacy in terms of pain relief, but at the expense of relatively high levels of adverse events, and with a high financial cost compared with other routes. Information about the relative efficacy of the different routes of administration for different outcomes should help to inform decisions about the suitability of sumatriptan as a migraine treatment, as well as about the most appropriate way to administer the treatment for individual patients. Plain language summary Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. For many people, the main feature is a painful, and often disabling, headache. Other symptoms include disturbed vision; sensitivity to light, sound, and smells; feeling sick; and vomiting. Migraine affects about 1 person in 8, mainly women, and mainly in the age range of 30 to 50 years. Sumatriptan is one of the triptan family of drugs used to treat migraine attacks. It can be given by four different routes: by mouth (oral), by injection under the skin (subcutaneous), by nasal spray (intranasal), and by suppositories (rectal). Separate Cochrane reviews for each of these routes provided information on how well sumatriptan worked at reducing headache pain in over 50,000 people with migraine. For oral, subcutaneous, and intranasal sumatriptan there was a large amount of information from good quality trials, but there was relatively little information about rectal administration. This overview found that a single dose administered via any of these routes was effective in relieving migraine headache pain. The subcutaneous route provided the best pain relief, with pain reduced from moderate or severe to none by two hours in almost 6 in 10 people (59%) taking the 6 mg dose, compared with approximately 1 in 7 (15%) taking placebo. The most commonly used doses of oral, rectal, and intranasal sumatriptan also provided useful pain relief. The oral 50 mg dose (the least effective of the commonly used dose and route combinations) provided complete relief of pain in almost 3 in 10 people (28%) compared with about 1 in 10 (11%) after placebo. Subcutaneous sumatriptan was also the fastest acting, providing more people with pain relief within one hour of treatment than any other route of administration. Adverse events, which were mostly of mild or moderate severity and of short duration, were more common with subcutaneously administered sumatriptan and higher doses of oral and intranasal sumatriptan than with other dose and route combinations.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Drug Administration Routes; *Review Literature as Topic; Acute Disease; Adult; Humans; Migraine Disorders [*drug therapy]; Numbers Needed To Treat; Serotonin 5‐HT1 Receptor Agonists [*administration & dosage]; Sumatriptan [*administration & dosage]; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD009108.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009108.pub2","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

The scope and focus of such reviews also vary widely, creating challenges for decision‐makers seeking to inform decisions by using the evidence on consumers’ medicines use. This is an update of a 2011 overview of systematic reviews, which synthesises the evidence, irrespective of disease, medicine type, population or setting, on the effectiveness of interventions to improve consumers' medicines use. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions which target healthcare consumers to promote safe and effective medicines use, by synthesising review‐level evidence. Methods Search methods:  We included systematic reviews published on the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. We identified relevant reviews by handsearching databases from their start dates to March 2012. Selection criteria:  We screened and ranked reviews based on relevance to consumers’ medicines use, using criteria developed for this overview. Data collection and analysis:  We used standardised forms to extract data, and assessed reviews for methodological quality using the AMSTAR tool. We used standardised language to summarise results within and across reviews; and gave bottom‐line statements about intervention effectiveness. Two review authors screened and selected reviews, and extracted and analysed data. We used a taxonomy of interventions to categorise reviews and guide syntheses. Main results We included 75 systematic reviews of varied methodological quality. Reviews assessed interventions with diverse aims including support for behaviour change, risk minimisation and skills acquisition. No reviews aimed to promote systems‐level consumer participation in medicines‐related activities. Medicines adherence was the most frequently‐reported outcome, but others such as knowledge, clinical and service‐use outcomes were also reported. Adverse events were less commonly identified, while those associated with the interventions themselves, or costs, were rarely reported. Looking across reviews, for most outcomes, medicines self‐monitoring and self‐management programmes appear generally effective to improve medicines use, adherence, adverse events and clinical outcomes; and to reduce mortality in people self‐managing antithrombotic therapy. However, some participants were unable to complete these interventions, suggesting they may not be suitable for everyone. Other promising interventions to improve adherence and other key medicines‐use outcomes, which require further investigation to be more certain of their effects, include: · simplified dosing regimens: with positive effects on adherence; · interventions involving pharmacists in medicines management, such as medicines reviews (with positive effects on adherence and use, medicines problems and clinical outcomes) and pharmaceutical care services (consultation between pharmacist and patient to resolve medicines problems, develop a care plan and provide follow‐up; with positive effects on adherence and knowledge). Several other strategies showed some positive effects, particularly relating to adherence, and other outcomes, but their effects were less consistent overall and so need further study. These included: · delayed antibiotic prescriptions: effective to decrease antibiotic use but with mixed effects on clinical outcomes, adverse effects and satisfaction; · practical strategies like reminders, cues and/or organisers, reminder packaging and material incentives: with positive, although somewhat mixed effects on adherence; · education delivered with self‐management skills training, counselling, support, training or enhanced follow‐up; information and counselling delivered together; or education/information as part of pharmacist‐delivered packages of care: with positive effects on adherence, medicines use, clinical outcomes and knowledge, but with mixed effects in some studies; · financial incentives: with positive, but mixed, effects on adherence. Several strategies also showed promise in promoting immunisation uptake, but require further study to be more certain of their effects. These included organisational interventions; reminders and recall; financial incentives; home visits; free vaccination; lay health worker interventions; and facilitators working with physicians to promote immunisation uptake. Education and/or information strategies also showed some positive but even less consistent effects on immunisation uptake, and need further assessment of effectiveness and investigation of heterogeneity. There are many different potential pathways through which consumers' use of medicines could be targeted to improve outcomes, and simple interventions may be as effective as complex strategies. However, no single intervention assessed was effective to improve all medicines‐use outcomes across all diseases, medicines, populations or settings. Even where interventions showed promise, the assembled evidence often only provided part of the picture: for example, simplified dosing regimens seem effective for improving adherence, but there is not yet sufficient information to identify an optimal regimen. In some instances interventions appear ineffective: for example, the evidence suggests that directly observed therapy may be generally ineffective for improving treatment completion, adherence or clinical outcomes. In other cases, interventions may have variable effects across outcomes. As an example, strategies providing information or education as single interventions appear ineffective to improve medicines adherence or clinical outcomes, but may be effective to improve knowledge; an important outcome for promoting consumers' informed medicines choices. Despite a doubling in the number of reviews included in this updated overview, uncertainty still exists about the effectiveness of many interventions, and the evidence on what works remains sparse for several populations, including children and young people, carers, and people with multimorbidity. Authors' conclusions This overview presents evidence from 75 reviews that have synthesised trials and other studies evaluating the effects of interventions to improve consumers' medicines use. Systematically assembling the evidence across reviews allows identification of effective or promising interventions to improve consumers’ medicines use, as well as those for which the evidence indicates ineffectiveness or uncertainty. Decision makers faced with implementing interventions to improve consumers' medicines use can use this overview to inform decisions about which interventions may be most promising to improve particular outcomes. The intervention taxonomy may also assist people to consider the strategies available in relation to specific purposes, for example, gaining skills or being involved in decision making. Researchers and funders can use this overview to identify where more research is needed and assess its priority. The limitations of the available literature due to the lack of evidence for important outcomes and important populations, such as people with multimorbidity, should also be considered in practice and policy decisions. Plain language summary Strategies to improve safe and effective medicines use by consumers: an overview of systematic reviews Review question:  This is an update of an overview first published in 2011. Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence from systematic reviews about the effects of interventions to improve safe and effective medicines use by consumers, irrespective of disease, medicine type, population or setting. Background:  Medicines are a cornerstone of treatment for many health problems. Many strategies exist to help people to use medicines safely and effectively, but research in the area is poorly organised across diseases, populations and settings. This can make it difficult for policy makers, health professionals and others to find and use the evidence about what works and what does not. Study characteristics:  This overview summarised the evidence from 75 systematic reviews on consumers' medicine use published to March 2012. Reviews covered acute and chronic diseases in diverse populations and settings; and evaluated a wide range of strategies to improve medicines use, including support for behaviour change, risk minimisation and skills acquisition. Medicines adherence was the most commonly‐reported outcome, with others such as knowledge and clinical outcomes also reported. Adverse events were identified less often. Key results:  Collectively, the results suggest that there are many different potential pathways through which consumers' use of medicines could be targeted to improve outcomes. However, no single strategy improved all medicines‐use outcomes across all diseases, populations or settings. Strategies that appear to improve medicines use include medicines self‐monitoring and self‐management programmes, while simplified dosing regimens and directly involving pharmacists in medicines management (eg medicines reviews) appear promising. Other strategies, such as delayed antibiotic prescriptions; practical management tools (eg reminders, packaging); education or information combined with other strategies (eg self‐management skills training, counselling); and financial incentives, may also have some positive effects, but their effects are less consistent. Some strategies, such as directly observed therapy, may be ineffective. Other strategies such as providing information or education alone may have variable effects, being ineffective to change some outcomes (eg medicines adherence) but improving others such as knowledge, which is key for informed medicines choices. Despite a doubling of the number of included reviews in this update, uncertainty remains about the effects of many interventions, and the evidence on what works was particularly sparse for several populations, including children and young people, carers, and people with multimorbidity. Quality of the evidence:  Included reviews often had methodological limitations ‐ at study level, review level, or both ‐ meaning results should be interpreted with caution.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Evidence-Based Medicine; *Medication Adherence; *Review Literature as Topic; Communication; Drug Prescriptions [*standards]; Humans; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Participation; Patient-Centered Care [*standards]; Self Care","10.1002/14651858.CD007768.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007768.pub3","Consumers and Communication"

Objectives The objective of this overview was to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on treatment options for women with pain or subfertility associated with endometriosis. Methods Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting pain or fertility outcomes in women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis were eligible for inclusion in the overview. We also identified Cochrane reviews in preparation (protocols and titles) for future inclusion. The reviews, protocols and titles were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in March 2014. Pain‐related outcomes of the overview were pain relief, clinical improvement or resolution and pain recurrence. Fertility‐related outcomes were live birth, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage and adverse events. Selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE methods. Review findings were summarised in the text and the data for each outcome were reported in 'Additional tables'. Main results Seventeen systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library  were included. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. Limitations in the evidence included risk of bias in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies, and imprecision in effect estimates. Pain relief (14 reviews) Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues One systematic review reported low quality evidence of an overall benefit for GnRH analogues compared with placebo or no treatment. Ovulation suppression Five systematic reviews reported on medical treatment using ovulation suppression. There was moderate quality evidence that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUD) was more effective than expectant management, and very low quality evidence that danazol was more effective than placebo. There was no consistent evidence of a difference in effectiveness between oral contraceptives and goserelin, estrogen plus progestogen and placebo, or progestogens and placebo, though in all cases the relevant evidence was of low or very low quality. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) A review of NSAIDs reported inconclusive evidence of a benefit in symptom relief compared with placebo. Surgical interventions There were two reviews of surgical interventions. One reported moderate quality evidence of a benefit in pain relief following laparoscopic surgery compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. The other reported very low quality evidence that recurrence rates of endometriomata were lower after excisional surgery than after ablative surgery. Post‐surgical medical interventions Two reviews reported on post‐surgical medical interventions. Neither found evidence of an effect on pain outcomes, though in both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine There were two systematic reviews of alternative medicine. One reported evidence of a benefit from auricular acupuncture compared to Chinese herbal medicine, and the other reported no evidence of a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and danazol. In both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Anti‐TNF‐α drugs One review found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between anti‐TNF‐α drugs and placebo. However, the evidence was of low quality. Reviews reporting fertility outcomes (8 reviews) Medical interventions Four reviews reported on medical interventions for improving fertility in women with endometriosis. One compared three months of GnRH agonists with a control in women undergoing assisted reproduction and found very low quality evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancies in the treatment group. There was no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between the interventions in the other three reviews, which compared GnRH agonists versus antagonists, ovulation suppression versus placebo or no treatment, and pre‐surgical medical therapy versus surgery alone. In all cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Surgical interventions Three reviews reported on surgical interventions. There was moderate quality evidence that both live births or ongoing pregnancy rates and clinical pregnancy rates were higher after laparoscopic surgery than after diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was low quality evidence of no difference in effectiveness between surgery and expectant management for endometrioma. One review found low quality evidence that excisional surgery resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates than drainage or ablation of endometriomata. Post‐surgical interventions Two reviews reported on post‐surgical medical interventions. They found no evidence of an effect on clinical pregnancy rates. The evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine A  review of Chinese herbal medicine in comparison with gestrinone found no evidence of a difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rates. However, the evidence was of low quality. Adverse events Reviews of GnRH analogues and of danazol reported that the interventions were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than placebo; and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates of adverse events than other treatments. Chinese herbal medicine was associated with fewer side effects than gestrinone or danazol. Three reviews reported miscarriage as an outcome. No difference was found between surgical and diagnostic laparoscopy, between GnRH agonists and antagonists, or between aspiration of endometrioma and expectant management. However, in all cases the quality of the evidence was of low quality. Authors' conclusions For women with pain and endometriosis, suppression of menstrual cycles with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUD) and danazol were beneficial interventions. Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis and excision of endometriomata were also associated with improvements in pain. The evidence on NSAIDs was inconclusive. There was no evidence of benefit with post‐surgical medical treatment. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence on harms was scanty, but GnRH analogues, danazol and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates than other interventions. Plain language summary Endometriosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews Background Cochrane review authors examined the evidence on endometriosis from Cochrane systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library . We aimed to summarise the evidence on treatment options that are available to women with pain or subfertility, or both, associated with clinically diagnosed endometriosis. Study characteristics We included 17 Cochrane systematic reviews. Fourteen reported measures of pain relief and eight reported fertility outcomes. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons and outcomes ranged from very low to moderate, due to limitations in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies and imprecision in the findings. Key results A number of interventions appeared effective in alleviating pain in women with endometriosis. These were gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues when compared with placebo, the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUD) compared with expectant management, danazol compared with placebo, and progestagens and anti‐progestagens compared with placebo. Laparoscopic surgical interventions also appeared to be effective for pain. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence on harms was scanty but GnRH analogues and danazol were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than placebo, and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates than other treatments.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Review Literature as Topic; Acupuncture, Ear; Anti‐Inflammatory Agents, Non‐Steroidal [therapeutic use]; Drugs, Chinese Herbal [therapeutic use]; Endometriosis [complications, *therapy]; Female; Gonadotropin‐Releasing Hormone [analogs & derivatives]; Humans; Infertility, Female [etiology, *therapy]; NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases [antagonists & inhibitors]; Ovulation Inhibition; Pelvic Pain [etiology, *therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD009590.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009590.pub2","Gynaecology and Fertility"

The LABA can be taken together with ICS in a single (combination) inhaler. Improved symptom control can be assessed in the individual; however, the long‐term risk of hospital admission or death requires evidence from randomised controlled trials. Clinical trials record these safety outcomes as non‐fatal and fatal serious adverse events (SAEs), respectively. Objectives To assess the risk of serious adverse events in adults with asthma treated with regular maintenance formoterol or salmeterol compared with placebo, or when randomly assigned in combination with regular ICS, compared with the same dose of ICS. Methods We included Cochrane reviews on the safety of regular formoterol and salmeterol from a June 2013 search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We carried out a search for additional trials in September 2013 and incorporated the new data. All reviews were independently assessed for inclusion and for quality (using the AMSTAR tool). We extracted from each review data from trials recruiting adults (participants older than 12 or 18 years of age). We combined the results from reviews on formoterol and salmeterol to assess the safety of twice‐daily regular LABA as a class effect, both as monotherapy versus placebo and as combination therapy versus the same dose of ICS. We did not combine the results of direct and indirect comparisons of formoterol and salmeterol, or carry out a network meta‐analysis, because of concerns over transitivity assumptions that posed a threat to the validity of indirect comparisons. Main results We identified six high‐quality, up‐to‐date Cochrane reviews. Of these, four reviews (89 trials with 61,366 adults) related to the safety of regular formoterol or salmeterol as monotherapy or combination therapy. Two reviews assessed safety from trials in which adults were randomly assigned to formoterol versus salmeterol. These included three trials with 1116 participants given monotherapy (all prescribed background ICS) and 10 trials with 8498 adults receiving combination therapy. An additional search for trials in September 2013 identified five new included studies contributing data from 693 adults with asthma treated with combination formoterol/fluticasone in comparison with the same dose of inhaled fluticasone, as well as from 447 adults for whom formoterol monotherapy was compared with placebo. No trials reported separate results in adolescents. Overall, risks of bias for the primary outcomes were assessed as low. Death of any cause None of the reviews found a significant increase in death of any cause from direct comparisons; however, none of the reviews could exclude the possibility of a two‐fold increase in mortality on regular formoterol or salmeterol (as monotherapy vs placebo or as combination therapy versus ICS) in adults with asthma. Pooled mortality results from direct comparisons were as follows: formoterol monotherapy (odds ratio (OR) 4.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 84.80, 13 trials, N = 4824), salmeterol monotherapy (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.08, 10 trials, N = 29,128), formoterol combination (OR 3.56, 95% CI 0.79 to 16.03, 25 trials, N = 11,271) and salmeterol combination (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.6, 35 trials, N = 13,447). In each case, we did not detect heterogeneity, and the quality of evidence was rated as moderate. Absolute differences in mortality were very small, translating into an increase of 7 per 10,000 over 26 weeks on any monotherapy (95% CI 2 less to 23 more) and 3 per 10,000 over 32 weeks on any combination therapy (95% CI 3 less to 17 more). Very few deaths were reported in the combination therapy trials, and combination therapy trial designs were different from those of monotherapy trials. Therefore we could not use indirect evidence to assess whether regular combination therapy was safer than regular monotherapy. Only one death occurred in the monotherapy trials comparing formoterol versus salmeterol, so evidence was insufficient to compare mortality. Non‐fatal serious adverse events of any cause Direct evidence showed that non‐fatal serious adverse events were increased in adults receiving salmeterol monotherapy (OR 1.14, 95% 1.01 to 1.28, I 2  = 0%,13 trials, N = 30,196) but were not significantly increased in any of the other reviews: formoterol monotherapy (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.04, I 2  = 15%, 17 trials, N = 5758), formoterol combination (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.27, I 2  = 0%, 25 trials, N = 11,271) and salmeterol combination (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44, I 2  = 0%, 35 trials, N = 13,447). This represents an absolute increase on any monotherapy of 43 per 10,000 over 26 weeks (95% CI 6 more to 85 more) and 16 per 10,000 over 32 weeks (95% CI 22 less to 60 more) on any combination therapy. Direct comparisons of formoterol and salmeterol detected no significant differences between risks of all non‐fatal events in adults (as monotherapy or as combination therapy). Authors' conclusions Available evidence from the reviews of randomised trials cannot definitively rule out an increased risk of fatal serious adverse events when regular formoterol or salmeterol was added to an inhaled corticosteroid (as background or as randomly assigned treatment) in adults or adolescents with asthma. An increase in non‐fatal serious adverse events of any cause was found with salmeterol monotherapy, and the same increase cannot be ruled out when formoterol or salmeterol was used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid, although possible increases are small in absolute terms. However, if the addition of formoterol or salmeterol to an inhaled corticosteroid is found to improve symptomatic control, it is safer to give formoterol or salmeterol in the form of a combination inhaler (as recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)). This prevents the substitution of LABA for an inhaled corticosteroid if symptom control is improved on LABA. The results of three large ongoing trials in adults and adolescents are awaited; these will provide more information on the safety of combination therapy under less supervised conditions and will report separate results for the adolescents included. Plain language summary Overview of the safety of regular formoterol or salmeterol in adults with asthma Background   Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways. When a person with asthma comes into contact with an irritant, the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten and the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell. This leads to the symptoms of asthma—wheezing, coughing and difficulty in breathing. No cure for asthma is known; however, there are medications that allow most people to control their asthma so they can get on with daily life. People with asthma can have underlying inflammation in their lungs, and they are generally advised to take inhaled corticosteroids to combat this inflammation. If asthma still is not controlled, additional medications may be used. One type of additional medication is the long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists, such as formoterol and salmeterol, which work by reversing the narrowing of the airways that occurs during an asthma attack. These drugs improve lung function, symptoms and quality of life, and reduce the number of asthma attacks. However, there are concerns about the safety of long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists, particularly in people who are not also taking corticosteroids. We prepared this overview to take a closer look at the safety of long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists, given alone (monotherapy) or in combination with corticosteroids (combination therapy), to adults with asthma. How the overview was done   We looked at previous Cochrane reviews on long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists and found a total of six high‐quality reviews on the safety of formoterol or salmeterol. These reviews included a total of 102 studies involving 70,980 adults or teenagers. The most recent search for new studies across all reviews was conducted in September 2013, and we added results from three further studies (1040 participants); these data have been incorporated into the overview. We compared formoterol or salmeterol monotherapy versus placebo, and formoterol or salmeterol combination therapy versus corticosteroids alone. We then used the results of these comparisons to look for differences between monotherapy and combination therapy. We also looked at formoterol and salmeterol separately to see whether one was safer than the other, either as monotherapy or as combination therapy. For each comparison, we looked first at risks of death and non‐fatal serious adverse events from any cause, and second at risks of death and non‐fatal serious adverse events related to asthma. What was found   The risk of fatal or non‐fatal serious adverse events was lower overall in trials with adults taking randomly assigned inhaled corticosteroids, but we found no significant difference between monotherapy and combination therapy in the impact of treatment on risk of death or serious adverse events. We saw no differences between formoterol and salmeterol monotherapy in risk of death or serious adverse events from any cause or in risk of death or serious adverse events related to asthma. We saw no differences between formoterol and salmeterol combination therapy in the number of deaths or serious adverse events from any cause or in the risk of death related to asthma. We found no clear differences between the safety of monotherapy and that of combination therapy with long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists, or between the safety of formoterol and that of salmeterol. The lower estimates of risk on combination therapy support current guidelines, which advise that long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists should be used only in combination with inhaled steroids for adults with asthma. This review suggests that combination therapy is probably safer than use of long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists alone, but we do not know exactly how much safer. It is important to continue to collect information on the safety of long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists. Three large ongoing trials may provide more information.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Review Literature as Topic; Adrenergic beta‐2 Receptor Agonists [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Adult; Albuterol [adverse effects, *analogs & derivatives, therapeutic use]; Asthma [*drug therapy, mortality]; Bronchodilator Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Drug Therapy, Combination [adverse effects, methods, mortality]; Ethanolamines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Formoterol Fumarate; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Salmeterol Xinafoate","10.1002/14651858.CD010314.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010314.pub2","Airways"

However, it is unclear whether these effects have an influence on perioperative mortality and major pulmonary/cardiovascular complications. Objectives Our primary objective was to summarize Cochrane systematic reviews that assess the effects of neuraxial blockade on perioperative rates of death, chest infection and myocardial infarction by integrating the evidence from all such reviews that have compared neuraxial blockade with or without general anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia alone for different types of surgery in various populations. Our secondary objective was to summarize the evidence on adverse effects (an adverse event for which a causal relation between the intervention and the event is at least a reasonable possibility) of neuraxial blockade. Within the reviews, studies were selected using the same criteria. Methods A search was performed in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on July 13, 2012. We have (1) included all Cochrane systematic reviews that examined participants of any age undergoing any type of surgical (open or endoscopic) procedure, (2) compared neuraxial blockade versus general anaesthesia alone for surgical anaesthesia or neuraxial blockade plus general anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia alone for surgical anaesthesia and (3) included death, chest infection, myocardial infarction and/or serious adverse events as outcomes. Neuraxial blockade could consist of epidural, caudal, spinal or combined spinal‐epidural techniques administered as a bolus or by continuous infusion. Studies included in these reviews were selected on the basis of the same criteria. Reviews and studies were selected independently by two review authors, who independently performed data extraction when data differed from one of the selected reviews. Data were analysed by using Review Manager Version 5.1 and Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2.2.044. Main results Nine Cochrane reviews were selected for this overview. Their scores on the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire varied from four to six of a maximal possible score of seven. Compared with general anaesthesia, neuraxial blockade reduced the zero to 30‐day mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 to 0.94; I 2  = 0%) based on 20 studies that included 3006 participants. Neuraxial blockade also decreased the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.79; I 2  = 0%) based on five studies that included 400 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between the two techniques (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.37; I 2  = 0%) based on six studies with 849 participants. Compared with general anaesthesia alone, the addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia did not affect the zero to 30‐day mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.51; I 2  = 0%) based on 18 studies with 3228 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between combined neuraxial blockade‐general anaesthesia and general anaesthesia alone (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09; I 2  = 0%) based on eight studies that included 1580 participants. The addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia reduced the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.98; I 2  = 9%) after adjustment for publication bias and based on nine studies that included 2433 participants. The quality of the evidence was judged as moderate for all six comparisons. No serious adverse events (seizure or cardiac arrest related to local anaesthetic toxicity, prolonged central or peripheral neurological injury lasting longer than one month or infection secondary to neuraxial blockade) were reported. The quality of the reporting score of complications related to neuraxial blocks was nine (four to 12 (median range)) of a possible maximum score of 14. Authors' conclusions Compared with general anaesthesia, a central neuraxial block may reduce the zero to 30‐day mortality for patients undergoing surgery with intermediate to high cardiac risk (level of evidence, moderate). Further research is required. Plain language summary Effects of spinals and epidurals on perioperative death, myocardial infarction and pneumonia: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews Epidurals and spinals are anaesthetic techniques that block the transmission of painful stimuli from a surgical site to the brain at the level of the spinal cord. They allow the surgeon to perform surgery on the lower part of the abdomen (below the umbilicus) or on the lower limbs with no painful sensation while the person remains conscious. In this Cochrane overview, we summarized relevant randomized controlled trials from nine Cochrane systematic reviews, in which epidurals or spinals were compared as a method of replacing general anaesthesia or were added to general anaesthesia to reduce the quantity of narcotics or muscle relaxants required during general anaesthesia. The types of surgery included were caesarean section, abdominal surgery, repair of hip fracture, replacement of hip and knee joints and surgery to improve circulation in the legs. When epidurals or spinals were used to replace general anaesthesia, the risk of dying during the surgery or within the following 30 days was reduced by approximately 29% (from 20 studies with 3006 participants). Also, the risk of developing pneumonia (chest infection) was reduced by 55% (from five studies with 400 participants). However, the risk of developing a myocardial infarction (heart attack) was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from six studies with 849 participants). When epidurals (and less frequently spinals) were used to reduce the quantity of other drugs required while general anaesthesia was used, the risk of dying during the surgery or within 30 days was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from 18 studies with 3228 participants). Also, a difference was not detected for the risk of developing myocardial infarction (from eight studies with 1580 participants). The risk of developing pneumonia was reduced by approximately 30% when a correction was made for possible missing studies (from nine studies with 2433 participants). No serious side effects (seizures, cardiac arrest, nerve damage lasting longer than one month or infection) were reported from the use of epidurals or spinals in these studies. The quality of the evidence for all six comparisons was rated as moderate because of some imperfections in how the studies were carried out. Therefore further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and may even change the results. .","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Review Literature as Topic; Anesthesia, Epidural [adverse effects, *methods]; Anesthesia, General [adverse effects]; Anesthesia, Spinal [adverse effects, *methods]; Heart Arrest [prevention & control]; Humans; Myocardial Infarction [mortality, *prevention & control]; Pneumonia [mortality, *prevention & control]; Postoperative Complications [mortality, *prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD010108.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010108.pub2","Anaesthesia"

Our understanding of quality standards in chronic pain trials has improved to include new sources of potential bias. Individual Cochrane reviews using these new standards have assessed individual antiepileptic drugs. An early review from this group, originally published in 1998, was titled 'Anticonvulsants for acute and chronic pain'. This overview now covers the neuropathic pain aspect of that original review, which was withdrawn in 2009. Objectives To provide an overview of the relative analgesic efficacy of antiepileptic drugs that have been compared with placebo in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and to report on adverse events associated with their use. Methods We included reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  up to August 2013 (Issue 7). We extracted information from each review on measures of efficacy and harm, and methodological details concerning the number of participants, the duration of studies, and the imputation methods used, in order to judge potential biases in available data. We analysed efficacy data for each painful condition in three tiers, according to outcome and freedom from known sources of bias. The first tier met current best standards ‐ at least 50% pain intensity reduction over baseline (or its equivalent), without the use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) for dropouts, an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis, in parallel group studies with at least 200 participants lasting eight weeks or more. The second tier used data from at least 200 participants where one or more of the above conditions were not met. The third tier of evidence related to data from fewer than 200 participants, or with several important methodological problems that limited interpretation. Main results No studies reported top tier results. For gabapentin and pregabalin only we found reasonably good second tier evidence for efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. In addition, for pregabalin, we found evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Point estimates of numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTs) were in the range of 4 to 10 for the important outcome of pain intensity reduction over baseline of 50% or more. For other antiepileptic drugs there was no evidence (clonazepam, phenytoin), so little evidence that no sensible judgement could be made about efficacy (valproic acid), low quality evidence likely to be subject to a number of biases overestimating efficacy (carbamazepine), or reasonable quality evidence indicating little or no effect (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate). Lacosamide recorded such a trivial statistical superiority over placebo that it was unreliable to conclude that it had any efficacy where there was possible substantial bias. Any benefits of treatment came with a high risk of adverse events and withdrawal because of adverse events, but serious adverse events were not significantly raised, except with oxcarbazepine. Authors' conclusions Clinical trial evidence supported the use of only gabapentin and pregabalin in some neuropathic pain conditions (painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain) and fibromyalgia. Only a minority of people achieved acceptably good pain relief with either drug, but it is known that quality of life and function improved markedly with the outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction. For other antiepileptic drugs there was no evidence, insufficient evidence, or evidence of a lack of effect; this included carbamazepine. Evidence from clinical practice and experience is that some patients can achieve good results with antiepileptics other than gabapentin or pregabalin. There is no firm evidence to answer the important pragmatic questions about which patients should have which drug, and in which order the drugs should be used. There is a clinical effectiveness research agenda to provide evidence about strategies rather than interventions, to produce the overall best results in a population, in the shortest time, and at the lowest cost to healthcare providers. Plain language summary Antiepileptic drugs to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia‐ an overview of Cochrane reviews Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (eg a fall, cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen are probably not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. Our understanding of fibromyalgia (a condition of persistent, widespread pain and tenderness, sleep problems, and fatigue) is lacking, but fibromyalgia can respond to the same medicines as neuropathic pain. Antiepileptic drugs (previously called anticonvulsants) are used for treating epilepsy, but have also been used for treating neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Many of the drugs have been the subject of individual Cochrane reviews. In August 2013 we collected all these Cochrane reviews on antiepileptic drugs together to provide an overview. Individual antiepileptic drugs work in different ways, and there is no expectation that they are equally effective. We found that only for gabapentin and pregabalin was there some evidence that they worked in long‐term nerve pain with diabetes (painful diabetic neuropathy) and pain after shingles (postherpetic neuralgia). Pregabalin also had evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain (typically pain after stroke) and in fibromyalgia. The drugs work very well in some people with these painful conditions, with pain reduced by half. However, only between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4 people will get this level of benefit, depending on the pain condition and the drug. Most people will get no pain relief. The antiepileptic drugs produced side effects in most people taking them, and for about 1 in 4 these could not be tolerated so they stopped taking the drug. Serious side effects were no more common with antiepileptic drugs than with a harmless placebo. The evidence we found did not meet current best standards, and as a result it may overestimate benefit. The biggest concern is a lack of any evidence for most drugs in most types of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For lacosamide and lamotrigine there is evidence of a lack of effect; for other antiepileptic drugs (including carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, valproate) there is no evidence of effect or insufficient evidence of effect.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Amines [therapeutic use]; Anticonvulsants [*therapeutic use]; Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids [therapeutic use]; Fibromyalgia [*drug therapy]; Gabapentin; Humans; Intention to Treat Analysis; Neuralgia [*drug therapy]; Pain Measurement; Patient Dropouts; Pregabalin; Review Literature as Topic; gamma‐Aminobutyric Acid [analogs & derivatives, therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD010567.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010567.pub2","Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness. Objectives How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long‐term abstinence (six months or longer)?  How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long‐term abstinence?  How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits? Methods The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments.  We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in  The Cochrane Library , for any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta‐analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events. Main results We identified 12 treatment‐specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head‐to‐head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96).  Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46).  Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs.  Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta‐analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta‐analysis of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56).  Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose‐dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin's UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments. Authors' conclusions NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use.  Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine's potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT. Plain language summary Medications to help people to stop smoking: an overview of reviews Background   Smoking is a main cause of early death throughout the world. There are a number of medications which can help people to quit smoking. Three of these, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and varenicline, are licensed for this purpose in the USA and Europe. Cytisine (similar to varenicline) is licensed for use in Russia and Eastern Europe. We reviewed studies of these and other treatments, including nortriptyline, to compare their benefits and risks.  Methods   We found 12 Cochrane reviews of different treatments. The treatments include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline); nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine); anxiolytics; selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant); clonidine; lobeline; dianicline; mecamylamine; Nicobrevin; opioid antagonists; nicotine vaccines; and silver acetate. The reviews were conducted between 2008 and 2012, and analysed 267 trials, covering more than 101,000 smokers. All the reviews used randomised controlled trials, and compared the active treatment with a placebo, and sometimes with other treatments. The outcomes were measured at least six months from the start of treatment, and the results were usually checked by testing breath, blood or urine. We also assessed the risk of harms from each treatment. We then compared NRT, bupropion and varenicline with each other, using a network meta‐analysis.  Results   NRT and bupropion helped about 80% more people to quit than placebo; this means that for every 10 people who quit with placebo about 18 could be expected to quit with NRT or with bupropion. Varenicline more than doubled the chances of quitting compared with placebo, so that for every 10 who quit with placebo about 28 could be expected to quit with varenicline.  Varenicline helped about 50% more people to quit than nicotine patch and 'other' NRT (tablets, sprays, lozenges and inhalers), and about 70% more people than nicotine gum. So for every 10 people who quit with NRT patch or with 'other' NRT, about 15 could be expected to quit with varenicline, and for every 10 who quit with NRT gum about 17 could be expected to quit with varenicline. Combining two type of NRT was as effective as using varenicline, and helped more people to quit than single types of NRT. There was little to choose between different types of NRT, apart from 'other' NRT, which helped slightly more people than nicotine gum; for every 10 people who quit with NRT gum, about 12 could be expected to quit with 'other' NRT.  NRT combined with nortriptyline or with bupropion was not more effective than NRT alone.  Both cytisine and nortriptyline compared with placebo improved the chances of quitting, with minimal risk of harms.    Bupropion carries a known risk of seizures (about 1 per 1000 users), but we found fewer than expected in the included and excluded trials, at about 1 in 1500. Although there may be a marginal increase in the likelihood of any serious adverse event while taking bupropion, we did not find increased risks of neuropsychiatric or heart and circulatory problems in the bupropion studies. The evidence for the safety of varenicline is still under investigation; we found no evidence from the trials that it is linked to an increase in neuropsychiatric problems, or with increased heart and circulatory problems.    Clonidine helped people to quit, but caused side effects. It is not clear whether or not mecamylamine used with NRT helps people to quit. Other treatments did not seem to help. So far, nicotine vaccines are not licensed for use anywhere in the world. Nicobrevin is no longer available in the UK, and rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline have all been withdrawn from the market.  Conclusions   NRT, bupropion and varenicline all improve the chances of quitting, with a low risk of harms.  Combination use of NRT is as effective as varenicline, and more effective than single types of NRT.  Cytisine has potential as a safe, effective and affordable treatment.  Nortriptyline improves the chances of quitting, with little evidence of harmful events.  We need continued monitoring of the safety of varenicline.  More research into NRT versus placebo is unlikely to change our understanding of the treatment.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Tobacco Use Cessation Devices; Adult; Alkaloids [therapeutic use]; Antidepressive Agents, Second‐Generation [*therapeutic use]; Azocines [therapeutic use]; Benzazepines [*therapeutic use]; Bupropion [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Nicotinic Agonists [*therapeutic use]; Nortriptyline [therapeutic use]; Quinolizines [therapeutic use]; Quinoxalines [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Review Literature as Topic; Smoking Cessation [*methods]; Smoking [drug therapy]; Varenicline","10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2","Tobacco Addiction"

No similar sized surveillance studies have been carried out in children with asthma, and we remain uncertain about the comparative safety of regular combination therapy with either formoterol or salmeterol in children with asthma. Objectives We have used the paediatric trial results from Cochrane systematic reviews to assess the safety of regular formoterol or salmeterol, either as monotherapy or as combination therapy, in children with asthma. Methods We included Cochrane reviews relating to the safety of regular formoterol and salmeterol from a search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews conducted in May 2012, and ran updated searches for each of the reviews. These were independently assessed. All the reviews were assessed for quality using the AMSTAR tool. We extracted the data relating to children from each review and from new trials found in the updated searches (including risks of bias, study characteristics, serious adverse event outcomes, and control arm event rates). The safety of regular formoterol and salmeterol were assessed directly from the paediatric trials in the Cochrane reviews of monotherapy and combination therapy with each product. Then monotherapy was indirectly compared to combination therapy by looking at the differences between the pooled trial results for monotherapy and the pooled results for combination therapy. The comparative safety of formoterol and salmeterol was assessed using direct evidence from trials that randomised children to each treatment; this was combined with the result of an indirect comparison of the combination therapy trials, which represents the difference between the pooled results of each product when randomised against inhaled corticosteroids alone. Main results We identified six high quality, up to date Cochrane reviews. Four of these related to the safety of regular formoterol or salmeterol (as monotherapy or combination therapy) and these included 19 studies in children. We added data from two recent studies on salmeterol combination therapy in 689 children which were published after the relevant Cochrane review had been completed, making a total of 21 trials on 7474 children (from four to 17 years of age). The two remaining reviews compared the safety of formoterol with salmeterol from trials randomising participants to one or other treatment, but the reviews only included a single trial in children in which there were 156 participants. Only one child died across all the trials, so impact on mortality could not be assessed. We found a statistically significant increase in the odds of suffering a non‐fatal serious adverse event of any cause in children on formoterol monotherapy (Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 4.83, I 2  = 0%, 5 trials, N = 1335, high quality) and smaller increases in odds which were not statistically significant for salmeterol monotherapy (Peto OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.05, I 2  = 17%, 5 trials, N = 1333, moderate quality), formoterol combination therapy (Peto OR 1.60; 95% CI 0.80 to 3.28, I 2  = 32%, 7 trials, N = 2788, moderate quality) and salmeterol combination therapy (Peto OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.91, I 2  = 0%, 5 trials, N = 1862, moderate quality). We compared the pooled results of the monotherapy and combination therapy trials. There was no significant difference between the pooled ORs of children with a serious adverse event (SAE) from long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonist beta agonist (LABA) monotherapy (Peto OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.33, 10 trials, N = 2668) and combination trials (Peto OR 1.50; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.75, 12 trials, N = 4,650). However, there were fewer children with an SAE in the regular inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) control group (0.7%) than in the placebo control group (3.6%). As a result, there was an absolute increase of an additional 21 children (95% CI 4 to 45) suffering such an SAE of any cause for every 1000 children treated over six months with either regular formoterol or salmeterol monotherapy, whilst for combination therapy the increased risk was an additional three children (95% CI 1 fewer to 12 more) per 1000 over three months. We only found a single trial in 156 children comparing the safety of regular salmeterol to regular formoterol monotherapy, and even with the additional evidence from indirect comparisons between the combination formoterol and salmeterol trials, the CI around the effect on SAEs is too wide to tell whether there is a difference in the comparative safety of formoterol and salmeterol (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.37 to 4.32). Authors' conclusions We do not know if regular combination therapy with formoterol or salmeterol in children alters the risk of dying from asthma. Regular combination therapy is likely to be less risky than monotherapy in children with asthma, but we cannot say that combination therapy is risk free. There are probably an additional three children per 1000 who suffer a non‐fatal serious adverse event on combination therapy in comparison to ICS over three months. This is currently our best estimate of the risk of using LABA combination therapy in children and has to be balanced against the symptomatic benefit obtained for each child. We await the results of large on‐going surveillance studies to further clarify the risks of combination therapy in children and adolescents with asthma. The relative safety of formoterol in comparison to salmeterol remains unclear, even when all currently available direct and indirect trial evidence is combined. Plain language summary Overview of the safety of regular formoterol or salmeterol in children with asthma Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways, the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. People can have underlying inflammation in their lungs and sticky mucus or phlegm may build up, which can narrow the airways. When a person with asthma comes into contact with an irritant (an asthma trigger), the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten, the airways become narrower, and the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell. This leads to the symptoms of asthma, which are wheezing, coughing and difficulty in breathing. There is no cure for asthma; however, there are medications that allow most people to control their asthma so they can get on with daily life. People with asthma are generally advised to take inhaled corticosteroids to combat the underlying inflammation in their lungs. If asthma is still not controlled, current clinical guidelines recommend the introduction of an additional medication to help. One type of additional medication is the long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists, such as formoterol  and salmeterol, which work by reversing the narrowing of the airways that occurs during an asthma attack. These drugs, taken by inhaler, are known to improve lung function, symptoms, quality of life and to reduce the number of asthma attacks. However, the evidence for the usefulness of long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists is more limited in children than adults, and there are concerns about the safety of these drugs in both adults and children. We did this overview to take a closer look at the safety of formoterol or salmeterol, either alone or given in combination with corticosteroid therapy, in children with asthma.  We looked at previous Cochrane reviews on long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists and also searched for additional trials on long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists in children. We found a total of 21 trials involving 7318 children that provided information on the safety of formoterol or salmeterol given alone or combined with corticosteroids. We also found one trial on 156 children which directly compared formoterol to salmeterol. There were more non‐fatal serious adverse events in children taking formoterol or salmeterol compared to those on placebo; for every 1000 children treated with formoterol or salmeterol over six months, 21 extra children suffered a non‐fatal event in comparison with placebo. There was a smaller and non‐significant increase in serious adverse events in children on formoterol or salmeterol and corticosteroids compared to corticosteroids alone: for every 1000 children treated with combination therapy over three months, three extra children suffered a non‐fatal event in comparison with corticosteroids alone. This number illustrates the average difference between combination therapy and corticosteroids. Our analyses showed that in fact the true answer could be between 1 fewer and 12 more children who would experience a non‐fatal event.  We did not have enough numbers from the small trial comparing formoterol to salmeterol, or from information in the other trials, to tell whether one long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonist treatment is safer than the other. There was only one death across all the trials, so we did not have enough information to tell whether formoterol or salmeterol increases the risk of death.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Albuterol [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *analogs & derivatives]; Anti‐Asthmatic Agents [administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Asthma [drug therapy, mortality]; Child; Drug Therapy, Combination [methods]; Ethanolamines [administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Formoterol Fumarate; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Review Literature as Topic; Salmeterol Xinafoate","10.1002/14651858.CD010005.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010005.pub2","Airways"

Most women in labour require pain relief. Pain management strategies include non‐pharmacological interventions (that aim to help women cope with pain in labour) and pharmacological interventions (that aim to relieve the pain of labour). Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to manage pain in labour. We considered findings from non‐Cochrane systematic reviews if there was no relevant Cochrane review. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 5), The Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 2 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to 31 May 2011) to identify all relevant systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of pain management in labour. Each of the contributing Cochrane reviews (six new, nine updated) followed a generic protocol with 13 common primary efficacy and safety outcomes. Each Cochrane review included comparisons with placebo, standard care or with a different intervention according to a predefined hierarchy of interventions. Two review authors extracted data and assessed methodological quality, and data were checked by a third author. This overview is a narrative summary of the results obtained from individual reviews. Main results We identified 15 Cochrane reviews (255 included trials) and three non‐Cochrane reviews (55 included trials) for inclusion within this overview. For all interventions, with available data, results are presented as comparisons of: 1. Intervention versus placebo or standard care; 2. Different forms of the same intervention (e.g. one opioid versus another opioid); 3. One type of intervention versus a different type of intervention (e.g. TENS versus opioid). Not all reviews included results for all comparisons. Most reviews compared the intervention with placebo or standard care, but with the exception of opioids and epidural analgesia, there were few direct comparisons between different forms of the same intervention, and even fewer comparisons between different interventions. Based on these three comparisons, we have categorised interventions into: "" What works"" ,“What may work”, and “Insufficient evidence to make a judgement”. WHAT WORKS Evidence suggests that epidural, combined spinal epidural (CSE) and inhaled analgesia effectively manage pain in labour, but may give rise to adverse effects. Epidural, and inhaled analgesia effectively relieve pain when compared with placebo or a different type of intervention (epidural versus opioids). Combined‐spinal epidurals relieve pain more quickly than traditional or low dose epidurals. Women receiving inhaled analgesia were more likely to experience vomiting, nausea and dizziness. When compared with placebo or opioids, women receiving epidural analgesia had more instrumental vaginal births and caesarean sections for fetal distress, although there was no difference in the rates of caesarean section overall. Women receiving epidural analgesia were more likely to experience hypotension, motor blockade, fever or urinary retention. Less urinary retention was observed in women receiving CSE than in women receiving traditional epidurals. More women receiving CSE than low‐dose epidural experienced pruritus.   WHAT MAY WORK There is some evidence to suggest that immersion in water, relaxation, acupuncture, massage and local anaesthetic nerve blocks or non‐opioid drugs may improve management of labour pain, with few adverse effects.  Evidence was mainly limited to single trials. These interventions relieved pain and improved satisfaction with pain relief (immersion, relaxation, acupuncture, local anaesthetic nerve blocks, non‐opioids) and childbirth experience (immersion, relaxation, non‐opioids) when compared with placebo or standard care. Relaxation was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and acupuncture was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and caesarean sections. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE There is insufficient evidence to make judgements on whether or not hypnosis, biofeedback, sterile water injection, aromatherapy, TENS, or parenteral opioids are more effective than placebo or other interventions for pain management in labour. In comparison with other opioids more women receiving pethidine experienced adverse effects including drowsiness and nausea.  Authors' conclusions Most methods of non‐pharmacological pain management are non‐invasive and appear to be safe for mother and baby, however, their efficacy is unclear, due to limited high quality evidence. In many reviews, only one or two trials provided outcome data for analysis and the overall methodological quality of the trials was low. High quality trials are needed. There is more evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological methods, but these have more adverse effects. Thus, epidural analgesia provides effective pain relief but at the cost of increased instrumental vaginal birth. It remains important to tailor methods used to each woman’s wishes, needs and circumstances, such as anticipated duration of labour, the infant's condition, and any augmentation or induction of labour. A major challenge in compiling this overview, and the individual systematic reviews on which it is based, has been the variation in use of different process and outcome measures in different trials, particularly assessment of pain and its relief, and effects on the neonate after birth. This made it difficult to pool results from otherwise similar studies, and to derive conclusions from the totality of evidence. Other important outcomes have simply not been assessed in trials; thus, despite concerns for 30 years or more about the effects of maternal opioid administration during labour on subsequent neonatal behaviour and its influence on breastfeeding, only two out of 57 trials of opioids reported breastfeeding as an outcome. We therefore strongly recommend that the outcome measures, agreed through wide consultation for this project, are used in all future trials of methods of pain management. Plain language summary Pain management for women in labour – an overview Women's experience of pain during labour varies greatly. Some women feel little pain whilst others find the pain extremely distressing.  A woman’s position in labour, mobility, and fear and anxiety or, conversely, confidence may influence her experience of pain. Several drug and non‐drug interventions are available, and in this overview we have assessed 18 systematic reviews of different interventions used to reduce pain in labour, 15 of these being Cochrane reviews. Most of the evidence on non‐drug interventions was based on just one or two studies and so the findings are not definitive.  However, we found that immersion in water, relaxation, acupuncture and massage all gave pain relief and better satisfaction with pain relief. Immersion and relaxation also gave better satisfaction with childbirth. Both relaxation and acupuncture decreased the use of forceps and ventouse, with acupuncture also decreasing the number of caesarean sections. There was insufficient evidence to make a judgement on whether or not hypnosis, biofeedback, sterile water injection, aromatherapy, and TENS are effective for pain relief in labour.  Overall, there were more studies of drug interventions. Inhaled nitrous oxide and oxygen (Entonox®) relieved pain, but some women felt drowsy, nauseous or were sick.  Non‐opioid drugs (e.g. sedatives) relieved pain and some gave greater satisfaction with pain relief than placebo or no treatment, but satisfaction with pain relief was less than with opioids. Epidurals relieved pain, but increased the numbers of births needing forceps or ventouse, and the risk of low blood pressure, motor blocks (hindering leg movement), fever and urine retention. Combined spinal‐epidurals gave faster pain relief but more women had itching than with epidurals alone, although urinary retention was less likely to be a problem. Local anaesthetic nerve blocks gave satisfaction but caused side effects of giddiness, sweating, tingling, and more babies had low heart rates. Parenteral opioids (injections of pethidine and related drugs) are less effective than epidural but there was insufficient evidence to make a judgement on whether or not they are more effective than other interventions for pain relief in labour. Overall, women should feel free to choose whatever pain management they feel would help them most during labour. Women who choose non‐drug pain management should feel free, if needed, to move onto a drug intervention. During pregnancy, women should be told about the benefits and potential adverse effects on themselves and their babies of the different methods of pain control. Individual studies showed considerable variation in how outcomes such as pain intensity were measured and some important outcomes were rarely or never included (for example, sense of control in labour, breastfeeding, mother and baby interaction, costs and infant outcomes). Further research is needed on the non‐drug interventions for pain management in labour.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acupuncture Analgesia; Administration, Inhalation; Analgesia, Epidural [adverse effects, methods]; Analgesia, Obstetrical [adverse effects, *methods]; Analgesics [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Cesarean Section [statistics & numerical data]; Female; Humans; Immersion; Labor Pain [*therapy]; Massage; Patient Satisfaction; Pregnancy; Relaxation Therapy [methods]; Review Literature as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD009234.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009234.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"

Incentives may be used in an attempt to increase the use of evidence‐based treatments among healthcare professionals or to stimulate health professionals to change their clinical behaviour with respect to preventive, diagnostic and treatment decisions, or both. Financial incentives are an extrinsic source of motivation and exist when an individual can expect a monetary transfer which is made conditional on acting in a particular way. Since there are numerous reviews performed within the healthcare area describing the effects of various types of financial incentives, it is important to summarise the effectiveness of these in an overview to discern which are most effective in changing health professionals' behaviour and patient outcomes. Objectives To conduct an overview of systematic reviews that evaluates the impact of financial incentives on healthcare professional behaviour and patient outcomes. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) ( The Cochrane Library ); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE); TRIP; MEDLINE; EMBASE; Science Citation Index; Social Science Citation Index; NHS EED; HEED; EconLit; and Program in Policy Decision‐Making (PPd) (from their inception dates up to January 2010). We searched the reference lists of all included reviews and carried out a citation search of those papers which cited studies included in the review. We included both Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time series (ITSs) and controlled before and after studies (CBAs) that evaluated the effects of financial incentives on professional practice and patient outcomes, and that reported numerical results of the included individual studies. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of each review according to the AMSTAR criteria. We included systematic reviews of studies evaluating the effectiveness of any type of financial incentive. We grouped financial incentives into five groups: payment for working for a specified time period; payment for each service, episode or visit; payment for providing care for a patient or specific population; payment for providing a pre‐specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care; and mixed or other systems. We summarised data using vote counting. Main results We identified four reviews reporting on 32 studies. Two reviews scored 7 on the AMSTAR criteria (moderate, score 5 to 7, quality) and two scored 9 (high, score 8 to 11, quality). The reported quality of the included studies was, by a variety of methods, low to moderate. Payment for working for a specified time period was generally ineffective, improving 3/11 outcomes from one study reported in one review. Payment for each service, episode or visit was generally effective, improving 7/10 outcomes from five studies reported in three reviews; payment for providing care for a patient or specific population was generally effective, improving 48/69 outcomes from 13 studies reported in two reviews; payment for providing a pre‐specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care was generally effective, improving 17/20 reported outcomes from 10 studies reported in two reviews; and mixed and other systems were of mixed effectiveness, improving 20/31 reported outcomes from seven studies reported in three reviews. When looking at the effect of financial incentives overall across categories of outcomes, they were of mixed effectiveness on consultation or visit rates (improving 10/17 outcomes from three studies in two reviews); generally effective in improving processes of care (improving 41/57 outcomes from 19 studies in three reviews); generally effective in improving referrals and admissions (improving 11/16 outcomes from 11 studies in four reviews); generally ineffective in improving compliance with guidelines outcomes (improving 5/17 outcomes from five studies in two reviews); and generally effective in improving prescribing costs outcomes (improving 28/34 outcomes from 10 studies in one review). Authors' conclusions Financial incentives may be effective in changing healthcare professional practice. The evidence has serious methodological limitations and is also very limited in its completeness and generalisability. We found no evidence from reviews that examined the effect of financial incentives on patient outcomes. Plain language summary How good are financial incentives in changing health care? There is a lot of interest in how well financial incentives influence the delivery of health care. Financial incentives are extrinsic sources of motivation and they exist when an individual can expect a monetary transfer which is made conditional on acting in a particular way. Since there are several reviews describing the effects of different types of financial incentives, it is important to bring this together in an overview to examine which are best at changing healthcare professionals' behaviours and what happens to patients. We therefore conducted an overview of systematic reviews that evaluated the impact of financial incentives on healthcare professional behaviour and patient outcomes. We searched a wide range of electronic databases from when they started up to December 2008. We included systematic reviews of studies evaluating the effectiveness of any type of financial incentive. We grouped financial incentives into five groups: payment for working for a specified time period; payment for each service, episode or visit; payment for providing care for a patient or specific population; payment for providing a pre‐specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care; and mixed or other systems. We summarised data using vote counting. We identified four reviews reporting on 32 studies. Two reviews were of moderate quality and two were of high quality. The studies that the reviews reported on were of low to moderate quality. Payment for working for a specified time period was generally ineffective. Payment for each service, episode or visit was generally effective, as were payment for providing care for a patient or specific population and payment for providing a pre‐specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care; mixed and other systems were of mixed effectiveness. When looking at the effect of financial incentives overall across different outcomes, they were of mixed effectiveness on consultation or visit rates; generally effective in improving processes of care, referrals and admissions, and prescribing costs; and generally ineffective in improving compliance with guidelines outcomes. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that financial incentives may be effective in changing healthcare professional practice. The evidence has serious methodological limitations and is also very limited in its completeness and generalisability. We found no evidence that financial incentives can improve patient outcomes.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Motivation; Capitation Fee; Delivery of Health Care [*economics]; Fee-for-Service Plans; Humans; Professional Practice [*economics]; Review Literature as Topic; Salaries and Fringe Benefits [*economics]; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD009255","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009255","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"
"CD008537.PUB2","Amato, L; Minozzi, S; Davoli, M","Efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of the Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2011","Abstract - Background Alcohol abuse and dependence represents a very serious health problem worldwide with major social, interpersonal and legal interpolations. Pharmacological treatments presently used are of uncertain effectiveness and there is even more doubt on the comparative effects and value for money. Objectives To summarize Cochrane reviews that assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (30 November 2010). Two authors independently screened, extracted data, summarised key characteristics of the included reviews and assessed their quality using AMSTAR; the quality of the evidence was summarised according to the GRADE methodology. Main results Five reviews, 114 studies, 7333 participants, satisfied criteria for inclusions. The outcomes considered were alcohol withdrawal seizures, adverse events and dropouts. Comparing the five treatments with placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures, three studies, 324 participants, RR 0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.69), moderate quality of evidence. Comparing each of the five treatments versus specific class of drugs, benzodiazepines performed better than antipsychotics for seizures, 4 studies, 633 participants, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.88) high quality of the evidence. Comparing different benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants among themselves, 28 comparisons, results never reached statistical significance but chlordiazepoxide performed better.   The quality of evidence was high for 3% of the results, moderate for 28%, low for 48% and very low for 20%. Authors' conclusions Among the treatments considered, benzodiazepines showed a protective benefit against seizures, when compared to placebo and a potentially protective benefit for many outcomes when compared with antipsychotics. Nevertheless, no definite conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines were possible, because of the heterogeneity of the trials both in interventions and in the assessment of outcomes. Data on potential harms are sparse and fragmented. Results do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS, but anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects. There is also not enough evidence of effectiveness and safety of baclofen, because only one study consider this treatment and of GHB for which no strong differences were observed in the comparisons with placebo, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants. Plain language summary Safety and effectiveness of medications for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome Alcohol abuse and dependence can cause serious health problems as well as interpersonal, social, interpersonal and legal consequences. Dependence on alcohol is evident by reduced control over drinking, tolerance to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome develops after stopping or reducing heavy and prolonged alcohol use. The most common symptoms include sweating, a fast pulse rate, tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transient hallucinations or illusions, agitation, anxiety and seizures. These are the result of changes in the central nervous system in an attempt to maintain normal function with alcohol consumption. Different types of medications are used to safely reduce the severity of withdrawal and the abuse of alcohol. Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials that examined the effectiveness and safety of medications for alcohol withdrawal syndrome were included in this overview. Participants in the review studies varied in age, gender, nationality, severity of symptoms and treatment as outpatients or inpatients. Five reviews, 114 studies, 7333 participants, were included. We considered the efficacy of the medication on alcohol withdrawal seizures, adverse events as a measure of safety and acceptability of the treatment as dropouts from the study. These outcomes were considered in 72 of the 114 studies. The treatments used were sedative benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, baclofen, GHB and PAN. Baclofen and GHB mimic alcohol effects and can rapidly reduce symptoms. PAN (psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide) involves administering low levels of nitrous oxide and oxygen gases so that the individual remains conscious and coherent. Comparing the five treatments with placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures (three studies, 324 participants, moderate quality of evidence). This was the only treatment with statistically significant findings. Data on potential harms were sparse and fragmented in these studies. Benzodiazepines also performed better than antipsychotics for seizures (4 studies, 633 participants, high quality of evidence). For the majority of our results, further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect. We assessed the quality of the evidence in the included reviews using GRADE, which looks at the quality of evidence for each outcome, taking into consideration the magnitude of the effect, the relevance of the data to the clinical question being asked, the sample size in the relevant trials, the methodological quality of the trials and the consistency of the findings.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures [*drug therapy]; Alcoholism [*complications]; Anticonvulsants [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Baclofen [therapeutic use]; Benzodiazepines [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Ethanol [*adverse effects]; Humans; Hydroxybutyrates [therapeutic use]; Nitrous Oxide [therapeutic use]; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome [*drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD008537.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008537.pub2","Drugs and Alcohol"

While the efficacy of biologics has been established, there is uncertainty regarding the adverse effects of this treatment. Since important risks such as lymphomas, serious infections and tuberculosis (TB) reactivation may be more common to the biologics but occur in small numbers across the various indications, we planned to combine the results from biologics used in many conditions to obtain  much needed risk estimates. Objectives To compare the potential adverse effects of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), interleukin (IL)‐1 antagonist (anakinra), IL‐6 antagonist (tocilizumab), anti‐CD28 (abatacept), and anti‐B cell (rituximab) therapy in patients with any disease condition except human immunodeficiency disease (HIV/AIDS). Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and open‐label extension (OLE) studies that studied one of the nine biologics for use in any indication (with the exception of HIV/AIDS) and that reported our pre‐specified adverse outcomes (serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs), total AEs, serious infections; specific AEs, namely, tuberculosis (TB) reactivation, lymphoma and congestive heart failure) were considered for inclusion. We searched  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, and EMBASE (to January 2010). Identifying search results and data extraction were performed independently and in duplicate. For the network meta‐analysis, we performed both Bayesian mixed‐treatment comparison models and arm‐based generalized linear mixed models. Main results We included 160 RCTs with 48,676 participants and 46 extension studies with 11,954 participants. The median duration of RCTs was six months and 13 months for OLEs. Data were limited for TB reactivation, lymphoma, and congestive heart failure. Using standard dose, compared with control, biologics as a group were associated with a statistically significant higher rate of total AEs (odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% credible interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.50; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14 to 60), withdrawals due to AEs (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.86; NNTH = 26, 95% CI 15 to 58), serious infections (OR, 1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.82, NNTH = 108 95% CI, 50 to 989) and TB reactivation (OR 4.68, 95% CI 1.18 to 18.60; NNTH = 681, 95% CI 143 to 14706). The rate of SAEs, lymphoma and congestive heart failure were not statistically significantly different between biologics and control treatment.  Certolizumab pegol (OR 4.75, 95% CI 1.52 to 18.65; NNTH = 12, 95% CI 4 to 79) and anakinra (OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.22 to 16.84; NNTH = 14, 95% CI 4 to 181) were associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of serious infections compared with control treatment. Compared with control, certolizumab was associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of SAEs (as defined in included studies: OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.32; NNTH = 18, 95% CI 9 to 162). Infliximab was associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of total AEs OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.35; NNTH = 13, 95% CI 8 to 505) and withdrawals due to AEs compared with control (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.14; NNTH = 10, 95% CI 5 to 30).  The overall numbers were relatively small for indirect comparisons. Indirect comparisons revealed that certolizumab pegol was associated with a statistically significantly higher odds of serious infections compared with abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab and rituximab; and anakinra was statistically significantly more likely than rituximab to be associated with serious infections. Certolizumab pegol was associated with a statistically significant higher odds of SAEs compared with adalimumab and abatacept. No statistically significant differences were noted between biologics in total AEs or withdrawals due to AEs in indirect comparisons. Authors' conclusions Overall, in the short term biologics were associated with statistically significantly higher rates of serious infections, TB reactivation, total AEs and withdrawals due to AEs. Serious infections included opportunistic infections as well as bacterial infections in most studies. Some biologics had a statistically higher association with certain adverse outcomes compared with control, but there was no consistency across the outcomes so caution is needed in interpreting these results. There is a need for more research regarding the long‐term safety of biologics and an urgent need for comparative safety reports of different biologics; preferably without industry involvement. National and international registries and other types of large databases are relevant sources for providing complementary evidence regarding the short‐ and longer‐term safety of biologics.  Plain language summary Side effects of nine commonly used biologics This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the side effects of biologics used for many conditions including inflammatory arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, cancer, and neurological conditions. We did not include studies on HIV/AIDS. The nine biologics we studied were: abatacept (Orencia ® ), adalimumab (Humira ® ), anakinra (Kineret ® ), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia ® ), etanercept (Enbrel ® ), golimumab (Simponi ® ), infliximab (Remicade ® ), rituximab (Rituxan or Mabthera ® ) and tocilizumab (Actmera ® ). The review shows that people using these biologics in the short term: ‐ will probably be a little more likely to experience more serious infections or tuberculosis than people who take placebo (fake drug); ‐ will probably be a little more likely to experience side effects or drop out of the study due to side effects than people who take placebo; ‐ will probably not experience more serious side effects* (other than serious infections), cancer, or congestive heart failure than people who take placebo. (*A serious side effect is a life threatening adverse event that can result in death or hospitalization and disability or permanent damage). We do not have precise information about other possible side effects and complications, including rare or long‐term side effects. What are biologics? Biologics are a group of medications that suppress the immune system and reduce the inflammation, even though suppressing the immune system can make it slightly harder to fight off infections. Best estimate of what happens to people who take biologics in the short term (range: 1 to 63 months) Serious side effects Among people who took any biologic, 127 out of 1,000 had serious side effects compared with 118 people out of 1,000 who took placebo (1% absolute harm). All side effects reported Among people who took any biologic, 770 out of 1,000 had side effects compared with 724 people out of 1,000 who took placebo (5% absolute harm). Drop‐out of study due to side effects Among people who took any biologic, 137 out of 1,000 dropped out of the study due to side effects compared with 98 people out of 1,000 who took placebo (4% absolute harm). Serious infections Among people who took any biologic, 35 people out of 1000 experienced serious infections compared with 26 people out of 1000 who took placebo (1% absolute harm). Tuberculosis Among people who took any biologic, 20 out of 10,000 had tuberculosis compared with 4 people out of 10,000 who took placebo (0.16% absolute harm). However, there were not many cases of tuberculosis so our confidence in this result is low. Lymphoma (Cancer of the blood) Over the short time frame of these trials, there may be little or no difference in the number of people who experienced cancer while taking any biologic compared with people who took placebo. However, there were not many cases of cancer so our confidence in this result is low. Congestive heart failure There may be little or no difference in the number of people who experienced heart failure taking any biologic compared with people who took placebo. However, there were not many cases of congestive heart failure so our confidence in this result is low.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Antibodies, Monoclonal [*adverse effects]; Biological Products [*adverse effects]; Humans; Immunologic Factors [*adverse effects]; Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008794.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008794.pub2","Musculoskeletal"

An overview of Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2010","Abstract - Background Patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are treated by three different techniques of cholecystectomy: open, small‐incision, or laparoscopic. There is no overview on Cochrane systematic reviews on these three interventions. Objectives To summarise Cochrane reviews that assess the effects of different techniques of cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Methods The  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (CDSR) was searched for all systematic reviews evaluating any interventions for the treatment of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis (Issue 4, 2009). Main results Three systematic reviews that included a total of 56 randomised trials with 5246 patients are included in this overview of reviews. All three reviews used identical inclusion criteria for trials and participants, and identical methodological assessments. Laparoscopic versus small‐incision cholecystectomy    Thirteen trials with 2337 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was relatively low. There was no significant difference regarding mortality or complications. Total complications of laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy were high, ie, 17.0% and 17.5%. Total complications (risk difference, random‐effects model ‐0.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.07 to 0.05)), hospital stay (mean difference (MD), random‐effects ‐0.72 days (95% CI ‐1.48 to 0.04)), and convalescence were not significantly different. Trials with low risk of bias showed a quicker operative time for small‐incision cholecystectomy (MD, low risk of bias considering 'blinding', random‐effects model 16.4 minutes (95% CI 8.9 to 23.8)) while trials with high risk of bias showed no statistically significant difference. Laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy    Thirty‐eight trials with 2338 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was high. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients had a shorter hospital stay (MD, random‐effects model ‐3 days (95% CI ‐3.9 to ‐2.3)) and convalescence (MD, random‐effects model ‐22.5 days (95% CI ‐36.9 to ‐8.1)) compared with open cholecystectomy but did not differ significantly regarding mortality, complications, and operative time. Small‐incision versus open cholecystectomy    Seven trials with 571 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was high. Small‐incision cholecystectomy had a shorter hospital stay (MD, random‐effects model ‐2.8 days (95% CI ‐4.9 to ‐0.6)) compared with open cholecystectomy but did not differ significantly regarding complications and operative time. Authors' conclusions No statistically significant differences in the outcome measures of mortality and complications have been found among open, small‐incision, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were no data on symptom relief. Complications in elective cholecystectomy are high. The quicker recovery of both laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy patients compared with patients on open cholecystectomy justifies the existing preferences for both minimal invasive techniques over open cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomies seem to be comparable, but the latter has a significantly shorter operative time, and seems to be less costly. Plain language summary Open, small‐incision, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy seem comparable with regard to mortality and complications Gallstones are one of the major causes of morbidity in western society. Prevalence of persons with asymptomatic and symptomatic gallstones varies between 5% and 22%. There is consensus that only patients with symptomatic gallstones need treatment. Three different operation techniques for removal of the gallbladder exist: the classical open operation technique and two minimally invasive procedures, the laparoscopic and the small‐incision technique. This overview evaluates the three surgical procedures and comprises fifty‐six trials with 5246 patients randomised. Complication proportions in all three techniques are high, but there seem to be no significant differences in mortality and complications between the three operation techniques. Both minimally invasive techniques have advantages over the open operation considering postoperative recovery. This overview of three Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group systematic reviews shows that the laparoscopic and the small‐incision operation should be considered equal regarding patient‐relevant outcomes (mortality, complications, hospital stay, and convalescence). Operative time seems to be quicker and costs seem to be lower using the small‐incision technique. The question today is why the laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the standard treatment of cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis without the evidence being present. We were unable to find any arguments supporting the 'gold standard' status of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In future trials, research should concentrate more on outcomes that are relevant to patients (eg, complications and symptom relief). Furthermore, the execution of the trials should comply with CONSORT requirements (www.consort‐statement.org).","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cholecystectomy [adverse effects, *methods]; Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic [adverse effects, methods]; Cholecystolithiasis [*surgery]; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008318","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008318","Hepato-Biliary"

Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, etanercept, infliximab, and rituximab in patients with RA. Methods This ‘Overview of Reviews’ was done by including all Cochrane Reviews on Biologics for RA available in  The Cochrane Library . We included only data on standard dosing regimens for these biologic DMARDs from placebo‐controlled trials. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were ACR50 and withdrawals due to adverse events. We calculated Odds Ratios (OR) for efficacy and safety outcomes and combined estimates of events across the placebo groups as the expected Control Event Rate (CER). Indirect comparisons of biologics were performed for efficacy and safety using a hierarchical generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) incorporating the most important study‐level characteristic (i.e. type of biologic) as a fixed factor and study and study*drug interaction as random factors. Main results From the six available Cochrane reviews, we obtained data from seven studies on abatacept, eight on adalimumab, five on anakinra, four on etanercept, four on infliximab, and three on rituximab. The indirect comparison estimates showed similar efficacy for the primary efficacy outcome for all biologics with three exceptions. Anakinra was less efficacious than etanercept with a ratio of ORs (95% CI; P value) of 0.34 (0.14, 0.81;  P =0.015); and likewise adalimumab was more efficacious than anakinra, 2.20 (1.01, 4.75;  P =0.046). In terms of safety, adalimumab was more likely to lead to withdrawals compared to etanercept, with a ratio of ORs of 1.89 (1.18 to 3.04; P = 0.009); anakinra more likely than etanercept, 2.05 (1.27 to 3.29; P = 0.003); and likewise etanercept less likely than infliximab, 0.37 (0.19 to 0.70; P = 0.002).  Authors' conclusions Based upon indirect comparisons, anakinra seemed less efficacious than etanercept and adalimumab. Etanercept seemed to cause fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than adalimumab, anakinra and infliximab. Significant heterogeneity in characteristics of trial populations imply that these finding must be interpreted with caution. These findings can inform physicians and patients regarding their choice of biologic for treatment of RA. Plain language summary Biologics for rheumatoid arthritis: an overview of Cochrane reviews This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of biologics on Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The review shows that in people with RA;       ‐  abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, and rituximab probably improve signs of rheumatoid arthritis such as the number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability.       ‐  anakinra probably improves signs of rheumatoid arthritis such as the number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability (but not as well as the others).  We do not have precise information about possible side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include a serious infection or upper respiratory infection. Rare complications may include certain types of cancer.   What is Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and what are biologics? When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints making them inflamed. This inflammation causes your joints to be hot, swollen, stiff, and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. If the inflammation goes on without treatment, it can lead to damaged joints.  Once the joint is damaged it cannot be repaired, so treating rheumatoid arthritis early is important. Biologics are a group of medications that suppress the immune system and reduce the inflammation in the joints. Even though suppressing the immune system can make it slightly harder to fight off infections, it also helps to stabilize an overactive immune system. By reducing the inflammation, the aim is to help prevent damage to the joints. Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who take biologics: ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other doctor or patient assessed aspects of rheumatoid arthritis) Among people who took abatacept, 44 people out of 100 experienced improvement in the signs of their rheumatoid arthritis compared to 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo (23% absolute improvement). Among people who took adalimumab 49 people out of 100 experienced improvement in the signs of their rheumatoid arthritis compared to 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo (28% absolute improvement). Among people who took anakinra 30 people out of 100 experienced improvement in the signs of their rheumatoid arthritis compared to 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo (9% absolute improvement). Among people who took etanercept 57 people out of 100 experienced improvement in the signs of their rheumatoid arthritis compared to 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo (36% absolute improvement). Among people who took infliximab 43 people out of 100 experienced improvement in the signs of their rheumatoid arthritis compared to 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo (22% improvement). Among people who took rituximab 52 people out of 100 experienced improvement in the signs of their rheumatoid arthritis compared to 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo (31% improvement). Side effects Among people who took adalimumab 8 people out of 100 dropped out of the study because of the side effects compared to 5 people out of 100 who took a placebo (3% absolute difference). Among people who took anakinra 9 people out of 100 dropped out of the study because of the side effects compared to 5 people out of 100 who took a placebo (4% absolute difference). Among people who took infliximab 11 people out of 100 dropped out of the study because of the side effects compared to 5 people out of 100 who took a placebo (6% absolute difference).  There may be little or no difference in people who dropped out because of side effects with abatacept, etanercept, and rituximab compared to people who took a placebo (fake pill).","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Abatacept; Adalimumab; Antibodies, Monoclonal [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine‐Derived; Antirheumatic Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Arthritis, Rheumatoid [*drug therapy]; Biological Products [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Etanercept; Humans; Immunoconjugates [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Immunoglobulin G [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Infliximab; Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Patient Compliance; Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor [therapeutic use]; Review Literature as Topic; Rituximab","10.1002/14651858.CD007848.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007848.pub2","Musculoskeletal"
